Choosing Kids Birthday Invitations for a Boy's Birthday

Young boys have active imaginations, abundant energy, and a love for games. Once combined, these ingredients create an active and memorable boy's birthday party. Start the party off the right way by sending kid birthday invitations that are just as fun and energetic as your son. 

Choosing the Right Kids Birthday Invitations for a Boy's Birthday 

Even though your guests will be children, it is still important to send kids birthday invitations that denote the type of party you're hosting. Young boys especially like to be active, and if the invitation portrays a theme designed for a boy's birthday, you are likely to have a full house on party day.

When planning a boy's birthday party, choose a theme that gets your son excited. Does he love trains, planes, or fire trucks? Does he constantly run around the house dressed like a superhero? 

Choose one of his favorite activities as inspiration for his birthday party theme and send matching boys birthday invitations. With so many creative kids birthday invitations for a boy's birthday, ranging from “wiggling” fire trucks to dynamic superhero cutouts, chances are that his friends will enjoy his interests too. 

Boys Birthday Invitations for a Planes, Trains and Automobiles Theme

If your son has countless toy airplanes and cars, perhaps a train set or two, then you might choose to incorporate these into a planes, trains and automobiles theme. You could choose kids birthday invitations featuring a sky background with planes flying across above an open train carrying different types of cars on the ground below. Of course, if your son is mostly interested in one vehicle, you could simply choose a boy's birthday invitations featuring fast cars, a conductor on his train, or airplanes zooming through the clouds. 

Kids Birthday Invitations for a Superhero Theme

Whether his favorite superhero flies, leaps tall buildings or drives a fast car, he probably wears a stylish costume and saves the world. Instead of focusing on one superhero, you could invite his friends to dress like their favorite superheroes for the party. Then, you might send boys birthday invitations with a red background and the words “Superhero Birthday Party” written in black across the top. In the background, there could be various crime fighters, such as Superman, Spiderman, and Batman to inspire recipients.

Kids Birthday Invitations for a Boy Who Loves Science 

If you have a local science museum, consider hosting the birthday party there. Usually, museums have hands-on exhibits and birthday party options to give kids an educational yet fun experience. You could send kids birthday invitations with a picture of the museum on the front to get everyone excited about attending.

Another option is to host a forensics birthday party and order a crime-solving kit or hire a party planner that offers this type of birthday party. A crime will be committed, and the boys must figure out “whodunit” by participating in a series of science projects, such as fingerprinting. You could send kids birthday invitations featuring a large magnifying glass, with the words birthday party in the center.

Remember to choose kids birthday invitations for a boy's birthday that complement your chosen theme. This will ensure there is no confusion when guests receive the birthday party invitation. You might even frame his themed birthday invitation as a keepsake, or place it into your scrapbook. As long as your theme is as unique as your son, his birthday party will be a success.
Buying a Baby Bunny Costume? Remember These 5 Safety Tips!

As the parent of a pair of twins, I can fully understand how you feel about dressing your bundle of joy up on special occasions. With Easter just around the corner, you want to make sure that your baby is the prettiest and cutest baby at the gathering, so you will not hesitate when selecting a bunny costume for your precious little one. Besides, who could resist a beautiful, soft and furry costume of a bunny? However, have you stopped to consider if you are choosing a safe set of costume for your baby?

Yes, you may have been caught by surprised with this question but it is not uncommon for parents to unknowingly compromise their baby's safety for looks. Very often, parents buy baby products on impulse and overlooked the importance of safety. Below are 5 questions to consider when you are choosing a baby bunny costume for your little one this Easter.

1. Are there easily removable parts on the costume?
Before you decide on which costume to buy, make sure you check whether there are any small buttons or pins attached to it. Babies are very curious and they might pull the small parts off when they are exploring so you are actually putting your baby at risk when these choking hazards are within their reach. Sometimes these small parts act as designs to enhance the overall look of the costume so you should check that these are not present. If you are purchasing your baby's costume online, you can still check the descriptions and picture carefully. If you really like the overall design very much and the buttons are merely for decorative purposes, maybe you can consider removing the buttons before putting it on your baby.

2. Is the costume in the right size?
Both too big and too small will cause discomfort to your baby. If the costume is exceptionally big, it will tend to slip off your baby's body and apart from catching a cold, your baby will find it uncomfortable. If the costume is too small, your baby will find it hard to breathe and that can be dangerous for your baby as he might get over-heated. So to ensure that your baby remains comfortable during the gathering, make sure you get a set that is just right for your baby. A little room for movement is fine but not too loose.

3. Are there any strings, ribbons or elastic materials on the costume?
If you are getting the bunny costume for a toddler over 18 months old, then ribbons are fine but not strings or elastic materials as those are more difficult to pull apart. However if you are getting it for an infant or a younger toddler, then these items should be avoided as they might accidentally tighten around the neck area when you are not aware. Such accidents could cause serious injuries or even death for a baby so you should not risk it. Getting an Easter bunny costume with bows for your little one is fine though but preferably you should get a jumpsuit to be on the safe side.

4. Is the material comfortable for your baby?
Not every baby is the same but you know your own baby best. Check to see if the material is comfortable for your baby and whether it is likely to cause any allergy. Usually bunny costumes for infants are made of very soft materials to ensure comfort for babies but to be on the safe side, you should check it out prior to buying. You do not want your precious little one to be fussy and upset the whole day!

5. Is the design too complicated?
Do not get carried away when you are looking at the various captivating designs. Babies need to get their diapers changed often so you have to ensure that the designs are not so complicated that it hampers diaper changing sessions.

With the above safety tips, you are now well on your way to getting a comfortable and gorgeous looking bunny costume for your little bundle of joy. You want to enjoy your gatherings and have lots of fond memories to share with your little one when he grows up so being extra cautious will be well worth the effort.
Buying And Choosing Your Fancy Dress Costume - To Hire Or Buy Vs Diy?

Buying That Great Party Kids Transformers Costume

Maybe I'm odd, but Halloween is one of my favorite holidays, and this year I'm thinking about getting a kids transformers costume for the big event.  I like to really do things up for this holiday, and have even entered in some costume contests in years gone by.  That might be a lot of work, though, because you usually must create your own costume if you want to have a chance at winning.  Most Halloweens I just shop online and buy something which catches my eye.

 You might be anxious about making an online purchase of something like a costume.  That is reasonable, but unnecessary.  The online venue is almost ideal for seasonal businesses like costume sales, because the online seller doesn't have to keep up infrastructure year round for a business that only make sales 2 or 3 months out of the year.  As you would expect, a strong group of businesses has established itself in this industry and there is plenty of competition to guarantee that they offer excellent prices and service.

 Many of the established online retailers these days provide a way for people who have purchased the product to provide information, either in the form of ratings or complete reviews.  Finding real buyers' reviews of that costume you are considering might be an absolute godsend!  The customers will give you the straight scoop, warts and all, and most importantly feedback about likely the worst hassle of all: size problems!  The last thing you need is usually to buy your usual size, then find out that their "S" is actually more like an "XS".  A too-big costume is a pain; a too-small costume will usually be a waste of money, unless you've got time to exchange it.

 A frequent gripe people have when buying costumes online is sizes!  The favorable sellers try to give you extra feedback on this subject, and customer reviews will frequently harp on it a lot.  Be sure to buy from a good, established online dealer that provides access to customer reviews (most of them do, these days).  The last thing you need would be to order your costume and find out that even though you usually wear an XL, the costume is too small.  Should you didn't provide yourself time to return the thing for replacement, you'll be kicking yourself even harder.

 What this all boils down to is a few rudimentary (and probably unmistakable) things you must do if you intend to be pleased with your costume.  Start thinking about your costume well in advance!  Don't leave the purchasing for the last minute, or you may not have time to exchange if there are issues.  Budget the time to spend going over previous customers' reviews.  This can save you lots of grief.  And last but not least be sure you order your transformers costume from a sound, reputable online outlet; there are now plenty of them to be found.

Caring for Costume Jewelry

Costume jewelry is fun, cheap, and easily available. However, they are not as long lasting and dependable as genuine jewelry, of course. That's why it is important to learn how to take care of these pieces and make them last throughout the different fashion trends.
These are some tips on how to properly take care of costume jewelries:
Many people tend to skip this step: Always read the proper care instructions first. Many instructions state that you must never let acidic substances such as ammonia, alcohol and vinegar come in contact with your pieces.
Aside from these, you must also avoid letting your jewelry pieces come in contact with lotion, cologne, and anything else that is moist. 
This means wiping your jewelry with a clean cloth after wearing them as your sweat might damage the material. 
Don't use soap and water when cleaning your costume jewelry pieces as well. That's because the soap will leave some residue on the pieces and cause them to look faded. 
 Dampen a piece of cloth to wipe and clean your jewelry and make sure to dry them afterwards. Never immerse your jewelry in the water for a long period of time.
When it comes to storing your jewelry, make sure that they it is not in a place where there is a radical level of temperature as this can be detrimental to the glue and the stone settings. 
Buy a cheap plastic box with many compartments (you can find this available in many hardware stores as these typically store nails, screws, and such) in order to separate your pieces when storing them. This type of container is usually cheaper and more durable compared to jewelry boxes.
 Don't keep your pieces in a storage box made of oak as this material can damage them.
 You can also use plastic bags to store your pieces. Try keeping small stud earrings, charms, and other tiny pieces in a medicine box.

Celebrating Valentine's With Couple Shirts

Valentine's Day is the perfect occasion for couples to flaunt their couple-ness. Public displays of affection, random mushiness, cute red hearts, heart-shaped chocolate, confetti...nothing is out of place on that day. 

What better way to let your inner romantic hold sway than to wear matching shirts with your significant other - letting the world know you are together?

Pink and blue love symbols never seem to grow old. In this age of war and disillusionment, more and more of us want to see words of love, happiness and affirmation around us, reminding ourselves that the positives in life still exist. No matter how many times we are told that love lasts beyond time and space, we want to hear it over and over again. 

Pink and red hearts, though, aren't the only thing you can sport on your Valentine's Day shirts. Proverbs and sayings about love, relationships and Valentine's make themselves seen and heard on the television, radio, billboards, and in cafes, restaurants and all public places. Why should your apparel be an exception? Proclaim your love for the person in your life with an ancient or modern saying about yourselves or each other. 

If you and your significant other feel incomplete without each other, your shirts can show that too. There are many shirts for couples that feature a graphic spread over two shirts. Seeing one of these on a person walking alone doesn't make sense, until you see the other "half" of the pair. A lock on one and a key on another, half a heart on each, scooter couples... the list of these continues to grow with each day, especially as designers keep working on them round the clock. 

Alternatively, you could have "Superman" and "Supergirl", a blue Hello Kitty and a pink one, or other pairs that feature similar themes. These shirts get a lot more mileage than the mushier ones, as they can be worn individually or together, as well as on days other than the Famous Fourteenth. For couples who watch the same TV show, support the same football team or do such similar things, shirts from that TV show or football team would be a great outfit for Valentine's. 

The Valentine's Day shirts could be a surprise gift for your significant other, or just something you pick up together from the store in the weeks before V-day. In fact, you could even put them into your loved one's Christmas stocking, and ask if s/he wants to wear them two months down the line. The greatest thing about Valentine's is the freedom to do exactly as you like, without having to conceal your fondness for each other. For this one day, don't be scared of appearing cliche-y, kitschy or anything like that. As long as you are relaxed and confident in what you're wearing, you'll pull it off. So go ahead, and get that pair of shirts for yourself and your loved one. Trust me, you won't regret it when you see yourselves in the mirror.

Chanel Fashion House Company Profile

From her original millinery store, opened during 1912, to the 1920s, Gabrielle 'Coco' Chanel rose to turn out to be one of the best fashion designers in Paris, France. Replacing the corset with comfort and casual chic, her fashion themes included straightforward suits and dresses, women's trousers, costume trinkets, scent as well as textiles. 
Coco Chanel claimed a birthdate of 1893 and a hometown of Auvergne; she was in reality born in 1883 in Saumur. Based on her account of her life story, her mother was employed in the poorhouse where Gabrielle was given birth to, and died when Gabrielle was barely six, leaving her father with five offspring whom he promptly abandoned to the guardianship of relatives.
She adopted the identify Coco during a short career as a cafe and concert singer 1905-1908. Initially a mistress of a rich forces officer followed by that of an English industrialist, Coco Chanel drew on the funds of these patrons in opening a millinery premises in Paris during 1910, expanding to Deauville and Biarritz. The two men additionally helped her to find shoppers among women of society, and her uncomplicated hats were to become fashionable. 
Soon Coco Chanel was expanding to couture, working in jersey, a first in the French fashion world. By the 1920s, her fashion house had expanded a great deal, and her blouse set a style trend with its "little boy" look. Her relaxed fashions, short skirts, and casual appearance were in sharp contrast to the corset fashions popular in the preceding decades. Chanel herself dressed in manly outfits, and adapted these more relaxed fashions which other women also found liberating. 
In 1922 Coco Chanel announced a fragrance, Chanel No. 5, that became and remained popular, and remains a valuable product of Chanel's business. Pierre Wertheimer became her partner in the perfume business in 1924, and possibly also her lover. Wertheimer owned 70% of the company; Coco Chanel received 10% and her acquaintance Bader 20%. The Wertheimers continue to run the perfume business now. 
Coco Chanel introduced her signature cardigan jacket in 1925 and signature "little black dress" in 1926. The majority of her fashions had a staying power, and didn't change a great deal from year to year -- or even generation to generation. 
Coco Chanel temporarily served as a nurse in World War I. Nazi occupation meant the fashion business in Paris was cut off for some years; Chanel's affair through World War II with a Nazi officer also resulted in a number of years of diminished popularity and an exile of sorts to Switzerland. In 1954 her return restored her to the first ranks of haute couture. Her instinctive, casual clothing including the Chanel suit once again caught the eye -- and purses -- of women. She introduced pea jackets and bell bottom pants for women. She was still working in 1971 when she passed away. Karl Lagerfeld has been chief designer of Chanel's fashion house since 1983. 
As well as her work with high fashion, Coco Chanel also created stage costumes for such plays as Cocteau's Antigone (1923) and Oedipus Rex (1937) and film costumes for several movies, including Renoir's La Regle de Jeu. Katharine Hepburn starred in the 1969 Broadway musical Coco based on the life of Coco Chanel.

Chanel: A Brief History of Chanel

Chanel was founded by Gabrielle 'Coco' Chanel. She opened her first shop, 'Chanel Modes' (Chanel Fashions) in 1910 at 21 rue Cambon in Paris. This was primarily a millinery shop, and the famous French actresses of the time soon flocked to buy her creations. 

In 1913, Coco opened a new boutique in Deauville and her line of jersey sportswear proved to be an instant hit. It changed the way that women felt about clothing and their lifestyles, too. She had led the revolution of dismissing the restrictive and tight corsets of the time in favor of comfort and casual elegance. This success led to the opening of the first Chanel Couture House in 1915, in Biarritz. Coco was now one of the most popular designers in Paris.

1921 saw the opening of another new office for the business, this time at 31 rue Cambon. It was here that Coco launched her now world-famous perfume, Number 5. This was followed, in 1924, by the founding of the 'Societe des Parfums Chanel' to produce, promote and sell the growing range of Chanel beauty products and perfumes. Coco was also commissioned to design the costumes for Jean Cocteau and Darius Milhaud's ballet, 'Le Train Bleu', that was performed by Diaghlev's Ballets Russes in the Theatre de Champs Elysees. At this time, her first costume jewelry range was also launched. 

The first of Chanel's most famous pieces of clothing, the 'little black dress', was introduced in 1926. The fashion magazine, 'Vogue', announced it as the 'new uniform of the modern woman' and its equivalent still remains a mainstay of many women's collections today. After visiting Scotland, Coco began using tweed in 1928 and created her first tweed suits.

In 1955, Chanel introduced her first fragrance for men, Pour Homme. In the same year her quilted shoulder bag took on the design that is still in use today. Coco was awarded the Fashion Oscar in 1957 as the most influential designer of the 20th Century; a title she richly deserved. Not a bad achievement for a girl who had been born part of a family of six children to a poverty stricken French family.

Gabrielle Chanel died on 10th January, 1971. However, the House of Chanel continues to enjoy International success. This has been, most recently, under the control of Karl Lagerfeld, who was appointed 'Art Director' in 1983. From this point, Chanel would encompass a wide range of different styles and visions, but the classics of Coco still remain best sellers.

Incidentally, Indian trend business has been drawing even western buyers. Evidently, the style fraternity in India have willingly adopted western designs protecting in mind each the Indian and western sensibilities.
