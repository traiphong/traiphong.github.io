Costume Jewellery - Everlasting Beauty

Costume Jewelry  is forever. It transcends time and age. Right from creating jewellery items out of flowers and pebbles, to adopting metals like gold and silver for longevity, jewellery has always been popular. While some designs are more suitable to a particular time, there are others have seemed to be just as magnetic thousands of years after they were designed. A few so called evergreen designs, continue to form a part of almost all jewelry stores, all over the globe.

Be in Helen of Troy or Cleopatra or for that matter the more contemporary Madonna, women have always adorned jewellery to enhance their look. While women are often associated with jewellery, this is not to say the men are far behind. Right from bracelets, rings to neck pieces; jewellery is loved by men and women alike. The magnetism of a finely crafted jewellery piece is unequalled by any other accessory and the fact that it can be easily handed down through generations adds to its charm.

The magnetism of well crafted jewellery makes it highly desired. No other accessory is as impactful as jewellery that combines fine quality and good workmanship. While platinum and gold jewellery has been rather popular especially on the red carpet, lately we find that costume jewelry is not far behind. Nevertheless what is it about jewellery that makes is so much more desired and valued as opposed to other accessory items.

The fact that jewellery is seen as an investment over and above being just an accessory is one of the main reasons for its popularity. Unlike other accessories such as bags, shoes and watches that loose value over time, jewellery is seen as an investment that will rise in value over the years and can be easily converted, if need be, into liquid cash.

Of course gold is seen as much more of an investment as opposed to silver jewelry but fine silver jewelry has indeed carved a niche for itself over the last few years. The affordability of fine silver jewellery is highly luring for buyers, though gold jewellery still rules the international market due to its better resale value. However, be it gold or silver jewellery, its charm lies in the flawless execution of its designs.

Be it contemporary designs or those inspired from the age old Scottish era, the trick to identify costume jewelry is, understanding the perfect blend of aesthetic designs and authentic metals. One without the other cannot be classified as good jewellery. Fake jewellery pieces not only rob your pocket but, could also damage your skin over time. So, when looking to buy platinum, gold or sterling silver jewelry, keep in mind that the metal must be of pure content. One must ensure that the jewellery being bought is authentic over and above being appealed too. Therefore, it is recommended that the purchase be made from a dependable source and a certificate of authentication be got too.

Indeed, it is true that costume jewelry has much more than just cosmetic advantages, though having all eyes on your when you enter a party is definitely a great attraction when setting off to buy an adornment.
Choosing Silver for Your 25th Birthday Party Invitations

Your 25th birthday should be celebrated in style, denoting a quarter century milestone. Steal a page from the 25th anniversary playbook and make silver your signature birthday color.

Why Choose Silver Birthday Party Invitations? 

Silver is a versatile metal that is used on casual jewelry, as well as formal silverware, serving ware and picture frames. For these reasons, it is also a versatile color that can signify a formal or casual gathering, making it a perfect choice for 25th birthday party invitations.

Your 25th birthday is the quarter-century anniversary of your birth, and stretching the silver anniversary theme to include your birthday puts a fun twist on the theme.

Selecting 25th Birthday Party Invitations

If you decide to have a silver celebration, it's essential that you prominently display this on the 25th birthday party invitation. This will allow guests to dress appropriately, as well as perhaps silver-themed presents for your celebration. 

Silver birthday party invitations do exist apart from anniversary invitations, ensuring that your choices will not be limited. You could choose to print your 25th birthday party invitations on silver paper with black lettering, mailed in a black envelope with silver foil lining, especially for a more formal gathering like a cocktail party. A casual silver birthday party invitation could have a colored background, such as light turquoise or dark green, combined with silver lettering and accents like a silver striped border.

Planning a Silvery 25th Birthday Bash

If you want to host a large party, you might consider an outdoor party or renting a venue to hold a large group. If you choose to host your party outdoors, this doesn't mean the party must be casual, depending on time of day and the setting you create. You could set up a sheer silver tent, either renting one or draping silver fabric over poles secured in the ground. Then set up tables beneath with silver tablecloths and silver candelabras holding ivory tapers. The party time should be in the evening, creating an elegant ambiance and the perfect setting for a delicious dinner beneath the stars.

If you decide to rent a venue, lay silver tablecloths, whether you'll have a sit-down meal, buffet, or drinks and dessert only, and use silver urns to house flower arrangements. If you'll have the party catered, request silver-rimmed plates to match your theme. To set the tone before the party, you could send a tri-fold 25th birthday party invitation with a glittering champagne glass on the front and words “25th birthday party” embossed across the front.

If you want to host a fun party with silver accents and your birthday takes place during a warm month, consider a pool party. You could sport a silver bathing suit, and if you'll play water games, could buy a silver volleyball to tie in with your theme. Your 25th birthday party invitations could be aqua or light blue and have pool party printed in bold silver lettering.

Don't think you have to wait for your 25th anniversary to host a silver-inspired party! Go ahead and apply it to your 25th birthday and send silver birthday party invitations to announce a stylish party guaranteed to shine.
Choosing The Right Costume For Your Little Child For Halloween

Halloween is probably the best time of the year to wear a costume, especially if you are a child. I know, I know, most people would say that Christmas is the best time of the year, but, fact is, it is not and one thing that you may want to keep in mind is that children love to dress up. Seldom do they show little enthusiasm when it comes to dressing up as their favorite characters and Halloween is probably the only time of the year wherein they are allowed to fully dress themselves as their favorite characters while they also have fun with their peers. 

Most likely, you, as their parent, may be thinking of what is the best costume for your kid, without you even realizing that you thinking of it alone is not enough. And no, you should not let your child choose the costume on his own, given that this may lead to the child not being happy with the choice. That being said and done, listed below are a few guidelines that you may want to consider reading if you were to want to choose the right and best costume for your little kid during the Halloween season. 

• Before you begin shopping, make sure that you have already decided on a hard budget. It is important that you make sure that you have decided on a certain budget or limit before you go shopping. How much you are able to spend or how much you decide to spend, rather, will likely depend on whether the costume will only be worn once or if you want the costume that actually can be used anytime of the year, especially when costume parties are held. 

• Consider the safety of your child first when you look for the costume for your beloved child. Make sure that you choose an outfit that they are comfortable in wearing and one that does not restrict their movement in any way. The costume should not be too long so they do not trip on it as well. Likewise, do not buy clothing that will constrict them and give them a hard time moving and breathing. Also, avoid using masks that limit vision. 

• Ask your child as to what sort of Halloween costume he or she wants. It is important that you consider what your child wants as well, given that he or she will be the one to wear the costume. If possible, be sure to try and cooperate with what your child wants and try to give this to him. Though, you may also want to make sure that you make your child understand if the costume is not good for him or her. 

• Lastly, always make sure that you shop for kids cinderella costume that are easy to take off, and make sure that the kids little witch costume is something that they can easily wear as well.
Choosing Your Dalmatian Costume

Dalmatians have a special place in the heart of many dog lovers. Stars of the 101 Dalmatians film, and seen on the back of many fire trucks up and down the land, these loveable dogs are unique and distinctive. Known as "spotty dogs" Dalmatians are instantly recognisable where ever they go. It is for this reason that, for that special dress up occasion, going as a Dalmatian will get you the impact you only dreamed of.

First of all, a family could easily go Dalmatian themed. The kids would obviously look adorable with all in one Dalmatian jumpsuits. They would be little puppies of all shapes and sizes. But more than that, Dad would look pretty smart as leader of the pack in an adult suit - tail wagging, ears flopping and leading the kids. To top it off, Mom would - of course - have to go as the meanest of all the female villains - Cruella De Vil. This is something the whole family can enjoy. Not only will you have memories of it for years, but the neighbours will wish they had thought of it first.

Secondly, even if it is just you going in a Dalmatian outfit to a fancy dress party, there is little to no explanation needed as to what your costume is. Looking around at other costumes or outfits for Halloween, they are sometimes completely off the wall and unrecognisable to most. A Dalmatian is a spotty dog, you are wearing an all in one spotty jumpsuit - job done!

Thirdly, what's not to love about Dalmatians? Heroes of the fire service, nemesis to Cruella - hey, you could even take your own fire hydrant with you as a prop. They are beautiful dogs, well known and non aggressive. No one is going to read anything into your choice of costume.

Last, but by no means least, is the cost of the Dalmatian outfit. It is minimal compared to some of the other prices out there for an average Halloween scare. Dalmatian costumes are distinctive and cost effective, a combination you cannot say of many fancy dress deals. So next time you sit down to think about what you or your family is going to wear for dress up, let Dalmatians be the first thing that comes to mind.
Christmas Gifts For Under 3's

What's the best gift for a young child? What presents would be suitable for 1 year old boy? What's suitable for a 3 year old girl? These questions are so common coming up to christmas time, and many people can be ill advised. Shopping for young children's gifts can be very hard, but if you follow the advice below you should have no problems selecting a suitable gift.

Newborn Babies - One Year Old Children

Newborn babies are fascinated by color, movement, shapes and sound. Children under the age of one don't really "play" in the way that older children do, as they have poor coordination and they have not yet learned how to pretend. Gifts for kids age 12 months or under should stimulate the senses of sight, hearing and touch.
Newborn babies and children 1 or below lack the coordination to "play" like older children do. What excites them is visual, audible, texture sensation. Gifts for this age range should be colourful, produce sounds, and have many different textures to stimulate the young child. Consider that young children put everything they can into there mouths, cardboard books are not really suitable for this saliva attack. Toys should be easy to wipe clean, not too heavy. But most importantly make sure they cant trap the fingers anywhere if the item has moving parts.
Some well received gifts for this age range include plastic books that produce sounds, stuffed animals/teddies, items with different colour/textured fabrics attached, and activity center mats and stations.

Toddlers Age 18-Months - Two Years Old

Toddlers between the age of 18 months and two years of age are toddling, walking, and exploring the world in a new way. Most two-year-olds do not yet have very good eye-hand coordination, so avoid toys and gifts that require keen dexterity and manipulation. Instead, find toys that encourage toddlers to think and hone skills like coordination and matching. Toddlers between the ages of 18 months and 24 months don't really play with other children per se, so holiday shoppers should avoid gift ideas that require more than one child (i.e., board games).
Toddlers are keen explorative children so finding a toy to keep them interested is difficult. Stick to toys that don't require precise manipulation/movement as they are still developing their hand-eye coordination. They generally don't play "together" so toys that require two or more children are probably best avoided.
Great gifts for toddlers include stacking bricks, simple train sets, puzzles that have very simple large piece's, push along vehicles. DVD's and videos are also a great item to buy a toddler at christmas, find out there favorite show and see if they are available to buy.

Toddlers Age 24-Months to Three-Years-Old

Gifts for this age are much easier to determine. The children now have better coordination, they observe activities closely, and are becoming very creative.
toys that imitate adult behavior are enjoyable to children this age, also things that can "make", be creative with are good.
Some appropriate holiday gift ideas for two-year-old's and three-year-old's include kitchen play sets, a grocery cart and play food, a doctor kit, baby dolls, dress-up clothes, fairy or princess costumes, indoor tents for a pretend camping trip, car or train sets, a plastic tool kit or tea set, and large Lego-type blocks. Many kids between the ages of two and three will also enjoy a Christmas gift of art supplies like age-appropriate coloring books, crayons, washable non-toxic markers, Play-Doh, finger paint and sidewalk chalk.

Kitchen play sets, garage set, vacuum cleaners etc are all good items to buy children of this age. Also paint sets, play-dough, and colouring activities are well received.
This gifts are a guide that should inform you in making a decision on what gift to buy, there are many other alternatives to those mentioned above. My main piece of advise is to narrow down your search to two or three items and then ask the parents if they would be suitable gifts. Nobody spends more time with these children than there parents, they are the most valuable source of information available to you.
Christmas Present Ideas On A Tight Budget

Teaching your youngsters a way to be considerate and caring when buying Christmas gifts should be a vital part of Christmas. It is also significant to teach them how to manage their own money in the holiday season. Be certain to let your children become involved in Christmas by letting them make or buy their own presents, even if they are small or inexpensive. If the children are too inexperienced to handle money, give them encouragement to make gifts for those they would like to give presents to. Homemade gifts are far more personal, and make for a fun and inexpensive Christmas for the kids. 

Creating a cheap Gift Basket 

There are a variety number| variety} of things you can do to save cash during the holiday season. Consider making a creative home made gift before going out and purchasing a gift. Gift baskets are both fun and straightforward to create and can be put together rather cost effectively. Take an image of yourself, your folks, or your children and put it in an inexpensive frame and give it as a gift to family members and close friends. You can also add more practical items to the hamper, for example cookie mix in a jar, a disposable camera, a hand-decorated photo album, note cards and a book of stamps, craft supplies, a flick rental gift certificate, a small radio or clock, stitching materials, a handy flashlight with batteries, home-made cookie mix complete with a recipe for baking, home baked bread with the recipe, new paper and a pen, or a gift token to their favorite book or department store. These inexpensive Christmas gift ideas may very well get utilised by the recipient, unlike plenty more pricey gifts. 

Other cash Saving Ideas 

An excellent way to save cash during the Christmas season is to spend less on wrapping paper and Christmas cards. If you own a {PC|P. C. Computer, you can design and print out your Christmas cards on cheap card stock paper. This also permits you to personalize the cards by adding a private picture, writing your own proverbs, and adding your own photographs to them, such as an image of your decorated house. You can even do this without a P. C. . Simply glue or tape your images to the card and write the Christmas message by hand. You may even wish to let the children make the cards, particularly the cards reserved for their grandparents. 

You can also make your own wrapping paper by purchasing cheaper paper such as that used to prepare packages for mailing. This type of paper can be discovered anywhere mail supplies are sold. You can decorate the paper with sponges dipped in craft paints, rubber stamps, or potatoes cut in half and carved into diverse Christmas shapes, like the look of a rubber stamp. Submerge the imprint into paint and have plenty of fun designing your very own wrapping paper. To give your gifts a more antique or country look, you can use a mix of brown wrapping paper and twine instead of a ribbon. Spending less on cards and wrapping paper will save you cash and let you spend more on other great Christmas gift ideas. 

Putting Some Thought Into the present 

Put some thought and imagination into different gift ideas before you decide to go out and get a Christmas gift. You'll possibly come up with a number of better, more private gifts, if you do a little work and make the gift yourself. For a great and invaluable present, refinish a cabinet or chest and give it to a family member or good friend. 

Think about items people wouldn't typically buy for themselves and what their interests are. You can give stuff like a gift certificate to the local pet store for the pet lover on your Christmas list. Give tickets to the movie theater to the film lover, or an entrancing book to an enthusiastic reader. Some other ideas such as pre paid photograph developing envelopes, a bag of cashews, or a month's unlimited tanning at a local tanning salon could also be well appreciated. Most of these gifts, while being very easy on your budget, will surprise and thrill the recipient. These are just a few examples of inexpensive Christmas gifts. Even the fussiest people can't pass up on a present that that is both considerate and has a private touch.
Christmas Traditions: 25 Meaningful Ideas for Families

The holidays are a time to revel in the gratitude and love we feel for one another. Here are 25 meaningful ways to celebrate your togetherness this season. 

1. Go for a family nature walk near your home to collect seasonal items that you can use in your holiday decor. If you live near a forest, the obvious choices are pine boughs and pinecones, but long dried grasses can look just as festive tied with a holiday bow. 

2. Make a few handmade holiday cards this year as a family. 

3. Make appreciation cards. Replace the annual Christmas letter in your holiday cards with a brief letter of appreciation for the recipient. 

4. Create or purchase new ornaments each year for the tree. Create or shop for an ornament that reflects a defining event or sentiment for the year. 

5. Enjoy a Family Night with special holiday crafts or games. 

6. Start a Christmas themed puzzle somewhere in your home. A puzzle table, placed in a quiet room is great for holiday visitors. Whenever your guests want to get away from the action, they can retreat to work on the puzzle. This can be a great stress reliever, and it is wonderful for those guests who always have to be busy doing something. 

7. Play special music. Ask everyone for their favorite holiday CD. Allow each family member to choose and keep them in the CD changer. 

8. Take a photo of your children standing in a particular spot each year (in front of the tree, by the front door) anyplace that will be consistent from year to year. Make a special holiday ornament or scrapbook album that depicts the growth and change of your family each year. 

9. Research the holiday traditions of your nationality. Adopt a few of these traditions into your annual celebration each year to celebrate your heritage. 

10. Ask each child to write a Dear Santa letter. (Small children can draw pictures). Keep a special record of these letters in an album or treasure box. 

11. Create an evening tradition of taking a family walk or drive in your neighborhood to view the holiday lights. 

12. Cut snowflakes from wrapping paper, festive holiday advertisements, or holiday cards, and string them together into a festive garland. 

13. Adopt a special cause each year and spend some time as a family helping those in need, or raising or donating money for a charity of your choice.

15. For fifteen minutes, write down things in your life that you are grateful for. Ask each of your family members to join you in creating their own lists. 

16. Bundle up and head outside. Make snow angels or build a snow fort with your kids. When it is time to warm up, build a cozy fire and roast marshmallows in your living room.

17. What is your favorite homemade holiday treat? Write down the recipe, and share it with your friends. Encourage them to do the same. 

18. Challenge each member of your family to fill a box or bag full of items to give away. Decide as a family where to make a donation. 

19. What was the best book you read this year? With whom would you most like to share its message? Purchase a copy for them and drop it off, anonymously.

20. Take your family to a performance of The Nutcracker. Purchase a CD or DVD of the Nutcracker to bring the memories home.

21. The holidays can take their toll. Make a holiday tradition of recharging your own batteries. Gather your daughter and your best friend and head to the day spa for a much deserved pedicure or massage. 

22. Reach out to those whom you have not seen all year. It takes a little extra effort this busy time of year, but make a goal to send a card or note to someone you think about but do not see much anymore. 

23. Keep a "Joy Journal" this holiday season, in which you record the funny things your kids say, joyful times you share, your favorite things to do with your family (and by yourself), and all the things for which you are grateful. Use your Joy Journal as a reminder of the facets of your life (and this holiday season) that are really important.

24. Give small and simple gifts (homemade cookies or a small book) to a few of the people who make your everyday life easier, such as the trash collector and postal carrier. 

25. Share your family traditions with friends and ask them to tell you about the family traditions that make their holidays sweeter.
Classic Cool Clothing For Men

Following fashion is a great way to show you're up with the trends and ready to experiment, but there's nothing like a bit of classic cool to add some charm to your wardrobe. There are some iconic looks for men that are so well loved that you're sure to feel cool the moment you slip into them. Even better, when you know what classic styles suit you, you'll be able to wear them year in and year out, no matter which looks are hitting the high street. 

 There are some basics all men should invest in, such as a blazer or sports jacket – perfect for transforming even the most causal of outfits into something a little smarter – a quality leather wallet and some smart loafers. These details are just the kind of things you need to ensure your wardrobe always has a hint of classic cool about it. 

 A well-cut suit is one piece of clothing that you're guaranteed to get plenty of wear out of and seeing as your most expensive suits aren't likely to be everyday wear, they are the perfect candidate for a little classic cool. Ignore flashy trends when it comes to choosing a suit and stick with a classic style that shows off your shoulders and back. Think Don Draper in Mad Men and rock a slim fitting suit with some serious style. Invest in extras such as cufflinks, a tie-pin or a card case if you're ready to rock the look. 

 Another look that shouldn't be underestimated is the laid back cowboy. Don't get carried away with a ten-gallon hat, but a pair of blue jeans, an understated shirt and some scuffed boots creates the kind of classic cool everyone wants a slice of. Accessorise with a brown leather belt with a hefty buckle and if you're brave and it's sunny outside you can even add a cowboy hat, but if you do, make sure your shirt and boots are plain. Otherwise, you could end up looking more like a parody of a cowboy than a cool critter. 

 There are classic looks to suit all seasons and when the summer rolls around you can be confident that you can stay cool without killing your charm. A great classic choice for warmer days is a preppy casual style, with tailored knee length shorts, a simple t-shirt, a pair of brown or black loafers (worn without socks) and of course, a pair of designer sunglasses such as Ray Bans Team loafers with light trousers and a polo shirt for slightly cooler summer days and you'll be set to take on all kinds of weather. 

 The bad boy look is one of the most enduring and best-loved looks there is. Popularised by silver screen icon James Dean in Rebel Without a Cause, the white t-shirt, jeans and leather jacket combination is one that's always sure to set hearts a flutter. Take a leaf from The Rebel's style book and keep it simple. Leather biker jackets look great with jeans and boots and sweep your hair back messily for a look with attitude. A more common trend is the adoption of mens chinos that are becoming more versatile with all kinds of clothing. Consider this as an alternative option to the traditional jeans.

Clever Homemade Halloween Costumes

There are many people each year that go on Halloween with homemade costumes and with costumes at the store getting more expensive with each passing year, it is evident that the need for clever homemade Halloween costumes is there. 

In the old days, people that were interested in doing their own costume would just grab a white sheet, cut two holes in it and then go out as a ghost. It is a still great idea for people that enjoy ghosts to wear such a costume but there are so many different things that could also be done. 

A vampire is a great example of a Halloween costume that can be made at home. All you need is a black sheet to change into a cape (or a cape if you have one handy for other purposes) and then a tin of make-up in order to make the face pale enough that the person can indeed come across as a vampire. To enhance the impression, you should get red lipstick or red crayon and smear some of it across the mouth and teeth of the person dressing up as a vampire. This will add the illusion of the person having just had their dinner of blood and even without the tooth extensions there it is still a special costume to have.

Another great example of a costume that can be entirely handmade is that of a mad scientist. All you need is a white laboratory smock and chemistry goggles - if you have children, they can lend their school equipment - as well as dark circles under the eyes made with grey make-up and voila, here is the big mad scientist look. If you get them to constantly open their eyes as wide as possible when they go out and then mess up their hair so that it looks as shaggy as possible then it will add an effect to the impression given by the costume. 

Ghosts, vampires and mad scientists are just three costumes that people used to purchase at the store all the time when they are shopping for Halloween. Nevertheless, there are dozen of other famous costumes that can be made at home (ghouls, goblins, witches and faeries) with a bit of creativity and effort and in the process end up saving lots of money. 

Inventiveness is the watchword for clever homemade Halloween costumes.

Collecting Pakistani Postage Stamps

Pakistan Postal Stamp Collection

It is not so obvious which stamp is the first issue of Pakistan. In 1854 East India Company issued the first modern postal system in South Asia. Before this issue, a local postage stamp was issued in 1852, known as "Scinde Dak". Scinde Dak is the oldest stamp in Asia and was used in Karachi City and remaining Sind regions. Since Karachi and Sind are part of Pakistan today, it is possible to claim that Scinde Dak is the first stamp of Pakistan. 

The East Indian issues of 1854 were used throughout the regions currently in Pakistan. However, since the notion of PAKISTAN did not exist at that period, it is theoretically difficult to call them (or Scinde Dak) the first stamp of Pakistan. The name PAKISTAN was invented around the 1930s to symbolize Muslim nations of the Indian Subcontinent: "P" from Punjab, "A" from Afghans (the majority of NWFP people), "K" from Kashmir, "S" from "Sind", and "TAN" from Baluchistan. 

Therefore, the first stamp of Pakistan, according to the orthodox classification among philatelists, is a set of British Indian stamps overprinted "PAKISTAN". Because of the turmoil due to the Partition of British India, the new state of Pakistan could not afford a commemorative stamp. One and a half months later, on 1 October 1947, new stamps of Pakistan were issued, which were British Indian stamps overprinted "PAKISTAN" by India's Printing Authority at Nasik.

Coming Up With A Cute Toddler Costume Idea

So you get to bring your toddler out for Halloween this year, how much fun it will be. Now you just have to worry about coming up with a cute, fun toddler costume idea that they are going to love wearing but which will not be rocket science for you to whip up in a matter of a few days.
Cute Critters
A great toddler costume idea is to dress them up as a cute little critter. Animals and bugs are lots of fun and kids just love them. They are probably the simplest type of toddler costume idea that you can possibly make, and all you need to do is use a hot glue gun to affix a cluster of cotton balls to the backside of a pair of footie pajamas.
Then you staple a matching pair of long ears that you have cut from construction paper, and you put these on a head band. Make sure that the head band actually fits your child's head before stapling the ears onto them.
Now you just want to dip into your makeup bag and pull out some tools that you can use to make a quick critter face. Draw some lines around their eyes, and use some red blush to give them rosy red cheeks.
Cat
Another easy toddler costume idea that you may want to run with is a cat. They are so simple to make, and all you need is all black clothing so they will be a black cat, but you can really go with whatever color you prefer. Now you just draw on some whiskers on their cheeks with a bit of eyeliner, give them a pink nose, and they are set to go.
If you want to finish off the look perfectly, buy a pair of cat ears that they can wear on their head, and make a tail out of construction paper in a tube and glue gun to hold the tail to the outfit.
Once you have your toddler costume idea down, why not think up a great couple costume idea so that you as the parents can go out dressed up when you take your little one out trick or treating. It will show that you are happy and into the holidays when you dress up with your child and you are really never too old to dress up for Halloween. Halloween is one of the most fun holidays, and one that your child will really enjoy when you dress them up as something cute.
Comstock Films: Real People, Real Life, Real Sex

Real people in adult movies – many of you may find this hard to believe, but this is a relatively new concept.  Starting with the launch of Redtube.com in 2005, "Real Sex" rapidly became the consumer's choice over traditional porn which dominated the industry for over a century.

 Over the last 4 years Australia has been drowned in "reality porn". From Youjizz.com to Porntube.com, there is no end to list of websites to choose from when looking for amateur adult entertainment.  So I decided to do a little research, just to see what the fuss was all about.

 Nearly 3 weeks and 66 coffees later I had rummaged through all the major websites, taking notes along the way on what was good and bad about them all.  What I found was quite surprising.  They all lacked the story behind the sex.  So on one hand there was "traditional porn" that told a story, but wasn't real, and on the other hand there was "reality porn" which was real, but didn't tell a story.

 So I set out on a mission to find out whether there was anyone…anywhere making films with both, real people and a story line.  On my travels I only stumbled upon one company that was doing it, Comstock Films.

 In the article Eyes Wide Open featured in the July 2007 issue of Oprah Winfrey's O Magazine, Violet Blue writes: "Comstock Films, maker of high-quality, documentary-style, real-couples videos, aggressively markets to women with the simple tagline "Women love real sex".  Director Tony Comstock shows what it looks like when two people who are in love have sex," says Blue. "It's beautiful—the antithesis of shapeless, boring porn in which everyone is just going through the motions."

 Comstock Films produces films about sex – nothing more and nothing less.  If you want to see the TV repair man walking in on an unsuspecting busty blonde, you might want to look elsewhere.  There is no airbrushing, no fake orgasms, and certainly no threesomes or orgies for that matter.

 These movies tell a story about couples who are passionately in love with each other, but that's not the best part.  Viewers are able to watch these couples grow together, and find out how they feel about each other through interviews and commentary before watching them make love.  This is groundbreaking stuff.  The intimacy between these couples is all that matters.  No devices or special techniques are necessary as there are adoring connections between the couples in these films.  And with such passion, no sex toys, Kama Sutra, or even sexy costumes are necessary to intensify the film.

 Raw, real sex – that's what Comstock Films offers… with hot results.

 How Real Is Too Real?

 Granted, sex without all of the bells and whistles of traditional pornography can sometimes seem a little dull.  Sometimes pornography becomes a more wildly sexual experience because it delves into the realm of fantasy.  However, I think that it can sometimes be difficult to relate to the traditional porn films.  If a man or woman wants to find a partner similar to the actors on the latest installment of "Debbie Does Dallas" they are going to have to start frequenting some pretty questionable night spots.

 Real sex also has its mistakes, its missteps, and its flaws.  Not every movement is perfect, sometimes people aren't moving completely in sync, and often the couples are hesitant about being too risqué.  However, as the couples move across the screen, viewers realize that while the performances aren't perfect – they're also not performers.  The imperfections then become a large part of the film's realism, making it all the more enjoyable.  In the article "Sex Homework" featured in Women's Health in November 2006, real life couple Stacey and Bryce said this about one of the Comstock favorites, Xana and Dax, "It's a real couple having sex.  They looked like people we would know and be attracted to.  We loved Xana and Dax because they're a real couple, with genuine orgasms and a sincere admiration for each other.  We watched it straight through, and even though we were as tired as usual, we had sex right after.

 Why Real Life Needs More Real People

 75% of all Australian couples we interviewed believed that most pornography movies they had watched seemed fake.  They thought that the performers and their orgasms just weren't believable.

 There's enough pressure already on men and women to have 'perfect' sex, so why should the pornography industry promote this unrealistic ideal?  With Comstock Films, those that view the movies see people just like them – imperfections and all.

 Not only is this reassuring, but it's empowering.  Seeing someone else with the same body type or the same desires in the bedroom encourages the viewer to try new things for themselves, to see themselves as a potential porn star as well – even if they never pull out a camera.

 Choosing Porn That Pleases

 People watch adult films for any number of reasons:

     * For stimulation – There is no aphrodisiac like watching others have sex to set the mood.  A hot adult movie can sometimes get a man or woman to a heightened state of arousal before sex ensuring an orgasm during sex. 
     * For bedroom ideas – There are many things you can learn from watching pornography.  The use of sex toys for example can create a whole new dimension in the bedroom.  Vibrators, dildos, and clitoral stimulators which are used in many adult films can provide that extra stimulation needed to bring your partner to orgasm.  Not to mention, these movies showcase a wealth of experience in Kama Sutra and modern sexual positions.
     * To enhance intimacy in a relationship – Couples who watch porn together enhance their intimacy by breaking down the false idea that pornography is somehow dirty or deviant. 

 Porn comes in a variety of shapes, sizes, and fetishes.  But the one fetish that hasn't been explored as much as couples might like is the idea of real people having real sex.

 Thank goodness for Comstock Films.  The documentary style filming makes a viewer feel as though they are peeking into a bedroom, much like their own, and getting a personal show.

 Never intrusive, though often intimate, the real life sex films create a connection with the audience in ways that the over-glamorized pornography world cannot.

 Another Bedroom Scene

 The bedroom becomes a difficult place to navigate when all of the role models are filled with silicone or have extraordinarily large penises.  With real people on the screen, real couples in real life can not only have genuine role models, but also a hot taste of what others are doing to show their partners they care.  Sure, real sex can be messy, but it's real.  And that's what counts.

Cosplay Subculture

Cosplay is a youth subculture originating in Japan. The moniker is derived from the words "costume" and "play", and it is believed to happen to be 1st thought up in 1984 with a Japanese studio executive named Nov Takahashi. When he wrote for Japanese science fiction magazines about the impressive costumes worn by attendees at the La Globe Science Fiction Convention, he gradually adopted the portmanteau term cosplay, which is used to explain the popularity these days.

The primary function of cosplay is that participants enjoy dressing up as their superheroes from anime, comic books, and video games. It's created to include, particularly when adopted in the west, individuals dressing up as characters from well-liked non-Asian fantasy and science fiction movies and games, such as Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings, Doctor Who and Wow.

Like a fashion concept, cosplay has additionally been observed to increase towards a style of dressing up not only as established, renowned characters, but as characters how the enthusiast has developed themselves. This is often a crossover into the Japanese Lolita style of dress, exactly where girls wear a unique, cute style. This allows girls who choose the appearance along with wish to fully adopt the Lolita style as street dress to savor the much less severe "Cosplay Lolita" style at cosplay events and venues.

Further trends and sub-genres in cosplay include "crossplay", that involves wearing the costume of the character from the opposite sex, and participants known as "dollars", who put on full body suits and masks to play characters with out their own faces on show, rather like sports mascots.

cosplay is generally something which takes place at parties, concerts, conventions and venues exactly where likeminded folks meet to show off their (typically hand made) costumes, socialize, and photograph other enthusiasts. The most popular location for such actions may be the fashionable Harajuku area of Tokyo. In the district of Akihabara, numerous cosplay themed cafes have been opened over the last decade to focus on the cosplayers, and the staff all put on anime themed costumes themselves.

Every six months, thousands and thousands of cosplayers flock to Tokyo to visit the Comiket convention and marketplace - the largest event on the planet for cosplay enthusiasts.

The idea of dressing and of taking part in role play based around popular characters also exists in the western world, where cosplay style outfits are worn to attend science fiction and comic book conventions. The largest could well be held annually in San Diego.
Costume Acquisition Strategies

Finding the perfect costume to wear can be a challenging task. There are many things one needs to consider before even starting the search. This article was written to give you some basic tips on how to find the perfect costume.

First, ask yourself why are you looking to purchase a costume? Costumes for small parties will probably be different than a costume you purchase for a play or a high budget film. Answering this question will help you answer some other key questions you'll need to ask before venturing out to make a purchase.

Now that you know why are you purchasing the costume you need to decide where you will be wearing it. A costume that will be worn to a fraternity party will be different than a costume you will be wearing to a more civilized party. I wouldn't want you to overpay for a costume when you could have just as easily spent less and accomplished the same thing with.

The length of time you will spend in the costume should be your next consideration. Many costumes are meant to look fantastic, but are not built for long term comfort. Working at a dinner theater for 8 hours a day in an uncomfortable costume will quickly make you wish you had spent a little more to get the comfortable costume.

The level of quality you need to get will be determined on the place you are wearing the costume to and the amount of comfort you desire. We've already addressed these two issues previously so you won't need to worry too much about this.

Price, time to purchase, and costume type will decide where you will need to go to obtain your costume. Outfits such as roman armor can be found in ecommerce stores much easier than they can be found in local shops. However, you need to make sure that shipping times will be quick enough to get to you before you need to wear it.

Not all costumes need to be kept indefinitely. Many people plan on selling or donating their used costume when they are finished with it. Places to give are the Salvation Army and Goodwill. If you decide you like money more than philanthropy, seek out consignment shops and other used good vendors to sell your costume to.
Costume hire and Costume rentals.

Finding the perfect costume can be a time consuming and expensive process. So why spend full price on a costume you are only going to wear once? From the right wig to the perfect fancy dress, costume hire or costume rental might be the right choice for you.

The easiest way to find your local costume rental store is by checking online or though the yellow pages. 

When looking to rent a costume, here are the basic steps that most costume for hire and costume rental stores follow.

Step 1 - Select your costume: This is normally the most enjoyable step out of the list. Costume shops will either have catalogs, or hanging ranks with costumes. When you have chosen your theme or costume itself, speak with the shop attendant. They may ask for your measurements so be prepared to give them. If you do not know, the shop attendant may be able to take your measurements for you, helping move the process along quickly.

Step 2 - Reserve it: This will ensure that your costume will be waiting for you on your special day.

Step 3 - Rental agreement: This is a contract between you and the rental company stating that you will return their products to them in the same condition they loaned it to you, on the date agreed up. Normally including information about damage fees. 

Step 4 - Pay for it: Like rental cars, most rental companies will have you use credit only. This will ensure that you bring the costume back to them, and so they can charge you for any damage done to the costume when you've returned it. 

Step 5 - Care for it: Wear antiperspirant and deodorant, avoid heavy perfumes, and take extra caution around cigarettes and wine.

Step 6 - Wear it!: Have fun and enjoy the night! 

Step 7 - Return it: Many stores have different return policies. Check with your rental store to see what they require of you. Some will ask you dry clean it, while others will take the costume as is.

Costume rental is the affordable way to enjoy any masquerade or costume party. Have fun and happy hunting.

And what is the first word that pops into your mind when you think costume? Halloween! I knew it. And the big choice there is whether it is a kid that needs a costume to look like a monster or a witch, or an adult needs a costume to look like a nurse or a police officer.

Then there are also theme parties, where you are invited to an event with the stipulation that you have to look like a cowboy, a vampire, a pirate, or any one of several other things, just to make sure that everyone looks foolish together. You never forget your toga parties, and there isn't much sillier than just wearing a sheet.

Costumes are super important for theatrical events as well, and you need to be prepared to get basic things for children's school plays, all the way through extremely complicated designs for Broadway type plays, where the details of the costumes are what help to let the audience get lost in the vibe. It's a very specialized process, at that point.

So one of the easiest ways to get into a costume is by buying one at a store or by ordering one online. There are year-round places to do this, and then there are specialty stores that pop up around Halloween for those specific needs, so don't afraid to search around, and second-hand stores typically will have things that work as well.

Then there is also the option of making your costume yourself. If you have a sewing machine, some creativity and a bright idea, you can make sure about anything with some fabric and the right mindset, so don't be scared to try your hand at it, as many of the most unique costumes are the ones that are completely created on spec.

Make sure that once you wear your costume out, you take lots of pictures as well, because what good would all the work, time and money spent getting yourself made up be if you didn't have any proof? Often people's favorite memories come from occasions when they were wearing costumes.

So pick a plan and run with it when it comes to costume ideas, and then make it happen either by buying it at a store or making it yourself, and make the most out of the experience as it presents itself to you at your celebration or event!
