Are You Looking For Cheap Fancy Dress Costumes For Your Kids?

Normal families online require cheap fancy dress costumes during holidays like Halloween, but if you are a member of my family, or, better wait one of my daughters, you always seem to find an occasion for your parents to purchase cheap fancy dress costumes. Every single weekend, my little angels come home from school and quickly head up to their walk-in closet and dress up in the most unusual dresses this world has ever seen! Don't get me wrong... my daughters look absolutely gorgeous in anything that they wear, but when you see some of their own personal miss-matches, you would think you were living in some artsy community for which my daughters are undoubtedly the President of. All of that said, the main reason behind telling you this amusing tale is to reveal my strategies on giving to my daughters what they require for their weekly fashion show in our living room while saving as much money as possible.

The first step is NEVER go to the thrift store! Thrifts are excellent for finding some excellent deals on cheap fancy dress costumes, but when you start looking at the quality of what some of these thrift stores carry, you start to think that you and your wife are actually prepping your children for a life on the streets! They can be just that, um, bad.

So, after realizing that thrift stores had the potential of turning my young, innocent daughters into something one might see on a New York City street corner, I quickly went online and found a ton of websites offering cheap fancy dress costumes, all of which carried product lines specifically geared towards children. Many of these websites offer the very same lineup as these thrift stores, but if you search through their stock, it really isn't that difficult to locate the right merchandise for your little angels.

The next thing one might want to consider is reading customer reviews. There are so many websites dominating the cheap fancy dress costumes market these days that the scam artists have attempted to take advantage of the market burst. It's true, and if you shop around as often as our family has for cheap fancy dress costumes, you start to be able to address these scam artists by their first names! One scam artist apparently can have over one hundred different websites under their name, all of which are leading people to one specific website (which is also under their name). This is why reading customer reviews are so important, for if customer reviews state that their experiences with these websites were predominately negative, then you instantly understand which website to avoid and which website to attempt a purchase.

Please, take my advice! If you don't, I am afraid that your children will be looking forward to their new cheap fancy dress costumes lineup for their fashion show and all they will get is an empty delivery box filled with financial frustrations. Trust me... not a good place to be in!

Afternoon Tea Party Bridal Shower Theme

Planning a bridal shower doesn't have to mean doing the same thing you've done for every other shower you've been to. Incorporating a fun theme can make the event more interesting and a lot more playful for everyone! Why not start with an afternoon tea party theme? Getting your guests involved will only increase the fun factor.

If you want your guests to arrive prepared, make sure their invitation states that they are invited for an afternoon tea party. Propose that they bring items to help lighten the mood, such as fancy gloves, hankies or hats that they can wear all through the shower. Getting the guests involved before the shower means fewer surprises during the shower and gives them an idea as to what they can expect. There will always be some guests who won't feel comfortable participating, so don't let them get you down. 

It's also a great idea to have some extra costume pieces for guests who don't have anything at home that they can bring with them. 

The best way to get the atmosphere of an afternoon tea is to serve tea in fancy tea pots. Borrow these from friends and family if you don't have them yourself. Just be careful with them to make sure they don't break. You'll also require fancy tea cups and saucers and inspire everyone to drink with their pinkie fingers in the air! Make it light-hearted and turn it into a shower game!

You can also use tea pots as vases and fill them with fresh flowers. These would make great centerpieces, placed on a doily or embroidered cloth. 

To go with the tea, serve small sandwiches filled with cream cheese and cucumber slices. Scones with homemade preserves and thick cream are also applicable for this theme. Small cookies and squares will add some variety to your party menu.

An afternoon tea bridal shower isn't complete without, of course, the tea. But don't feel constrained to only this beverage. You can serve iced tea, coffee, or punch also, but keep in the spirit by serving all of the drinks in tea cups.

If you have lots of space, set up small tables with four or five chairs at each table for the atmosphere of smaller parties going on at the same time. If tea is the main beverage, you can set up one pot per table and let your guests help themselves. 

Keep the bride involved in the theme by providing some tea party garb for her. She may appreciate the theme since it will take some of the attention and pressure off of her as the guests get caught up in their tea party. Having a theme also helps to keep the festivities going without those awkward silences that often happen since it gives people who don't have a lot in common something to talk about.

Make sure that you and your co-hosts are ready to jump head first into the shower theme. The more you are ready to get into it, the more willing your guests will be to follow suit. Your enthusiasm will be contagious and will make everyone else more comfortable to join in. If you're having fun, your guests will too.

Alice In Wonderland Costumes For Halloween Parties

Although the 2010 tale was improved to have happened in Alice's teenage years, the magic and fantasy which we have all noticed in Lewis Carroll's story lived on in the motion picture adaptation. Tim Burton's version was full of color and distinct images. With a mix of Tim Burton's dark and brooding creativity and Lewis Carroll's unusual storyline and characters, the Alice in Wonderland 2010 video adaptation became this year's top choice for kids and adults alike.

Aside from being a well-loved story and film, Alice in Wonderland has also become a top selection for costume-themed activities and Halloween parties; Alice's fancy dress has always been a highly recognizable piece along with the Queen of Hearts and the Madhatter.

Alice's most widely used attire is her glowing blue puffy-sleeved blouse and white apron. This gown gives her the adventurous type of farm girl look which stays timeless throughout the years. This famous dress has been a fairy tale favorite and has also been used for other fairy tale film adaptations.

In the 2010 version of Alice in Wonderland, Alice's apparel took on a distinct design. Instead of the casual Victorian era outfit, she is seen donning an off-shoulder blue outfit instead and through the film, her outfit changes size and color, and at one point, she put on the Red Queen's curtains.

Alice isn't the only one who alters clothing throughout the movie. The sewing-obsessed Madhatter changes hats in the course of the video as well and has even supplied to give the Red Queen a hat makeover. However, being the Red Queen, she has declined almost every style suggested to her.

For males, the Madhatter is regarded as the best pick since he has the most eye-catching suit in the story. Since there are various well-known adaptations of Alice in Wonderland, any individual who prefers to come as the Madhatter can choose from two different designs that are equally recognizable; however, since the 2010 film is still fresh in everyone's memory, Johnny Depp's suit is highly recommended.

If you want to be the intelligent and mysterious cat, the Cheshire cat is a good choice for both men and women. Although the Cheshire cat has often been pictured as a male, ladies could also costume as the Cheshire cat and not be mistaken for simply a girl in a cat suit. The Cheshire cat's stripped tail makes this costume easily familiar.

Absalom the Caterpillar and time-obsessed White Hair are only two of the three most popular talking characters in Wonderland. Absalom provides help to Alice during her most troubling occasions while the White Hair constantly reminds her to show up on time on tea parties. If you want to represent any of these two characters in parties, you could come as the caterpillar in this huge and multi-legged caterpillar costume or as the White Rabbit in this full length attire, complete with bunny ears.

Last but not the least, if you want to portray a villain, the Red Queen or the Queen of Hearts would be a very good choice. She is, after all, known for her stern attitude and merciless ways; your costume will be very recognizable in a crowd.
Alice in Wonderland Costumes

The book "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland" by way of the English writer, Charles Lutwidge Dodgson (better known by his pseudonym, Lewis Carroll) has long been a beloved book for many generations. The tale of a little girl Alice falling down the rabbit hole into a land of illusions filled with very unusual creatures has an enduring appeal.  It has inspired plays, games, books, and more than 20 film productions, going all the way back toward the earliest years of movies (the first film was made in 1903!).  The story is experiencing yet another resurgence in popularity this year, as it returns toward the big screen in another Disney live-action production.  With all the excitement surrounding the novel movie, the wonderland costume theme is going to be very popular this year for Halloween.

This year's Alice in Wonderland movie is a different take on the story, more inspired by the novel books than a conventional film adaptation of those stories.  All of the familiar characters are there, but Alice herself has stopped being a little girl.  The film imagines what would happen if Alice returned to Wonderland as a young woman, with only hazy memories of her prior visit, a visit that has become to her no more than a dream she's got from night to night.  Will she recall her friends?  Will she help them as they face the Red Queen and her ferocious minions, the Bandersnatch and also the Jabberwocky, as they try to restore the White Queen to her throne?  Of course she will!  But that story is only half the enjoyment of this movie, thanks for the creative team behind it.

The movie marks the 6th collaboration of director Tim Burton and actor Johnny Depp; and the movie is exactly the sort of visual feast you would expect if you have seen any of their previous movies.  They are joined by Colleen Atwood, one of the better costume designers in Hollywood, who has worked with Burton even more often than Depp has.  Combine Tim Burton's strong visual style, Atwood's incredible skill with costumes, and Depp's passion for outrageous characters.  You can actually imagine what these three will come up with when working with something like Wonderland as well as the Mad Hatter as their material, but you'll be able to bet it will look incredible!  Any wonderland costume based on this film is going to be distinctive, gorgeous, and very much out of the ordinary.  Wonderland Costumes have been a staple for Halloween and other "dress-up" occasions for almost as long as the story has long been around, but with this year's film, you'll be able to bet that this will be one of the most popular themes for 2010.
All About Gypsy Skirts

For those who enjoy wearing hippie clothes, gypsy skirts are a real treat. The sense of freedom and nostalgia coupled with what could only be called true femininity make these peasant skirts really attractive fashion options.

If you are unfamiliar with these boho skirts think back to what girls wore frequently in the 60s or might wear now to a Renaissance fair. Besides the bell bottom jeans, girls were most noted for wearing dresses and long skirts made of flowing materials. Sometimes they were broomstick skirts that were tie dyed or tiered. Either way gypsy skirts are now iconic symbols of the 60s fashion for women.

Because the clothing in the 60s was often patterned after that of other cultures, tribal Indian skirts or gypsy clothing and motifs were often worn. The light cotton fabrics were well suited to tie dye, or might be embroidered on the hem or around the pockets.

These hippie skirts were also often patterned after cholis like the harem skirts or pants you think of as well, tight fitting to the body, or draped over with a piece of matching fabric over the shoulder or over the face. For Renaissance fairs you might throw in a coned hat with matching cloth draped from it.

Such gypsy costume pieces were not readily available at the local 5 and dime and had to be handmade in the 60s. Today, you have more outlets for finding gypsy skirts like the internet, but you may also want to make your own like the women of the 60s did.

Embroidered skirt hems make a nice addition to your gypsy skirt. Yellows, golds, greens, and primary color embroidery floss were typical color choices for the skirt designs. Such lovely designs as flowers, rainbows, peace signs and the like were frequently used. However, in modern times, simple words could also be used to great effect, much like tattoos.

You can do this embellishing by hand with needle and thread or with a sewing machine as most typical sewing machines come with an embroidery stitch these days. Since we live in modern times, you can even pay someone to do it with an embroidery machine. This works great for gypsy costumes or hippie costumes because you can make several with the same template, but use different threads to make each costume different.

If you want to be really fancy you could choose to add a metallic embroidery thread to the mix. Gypsy clothing often had a metallic look, like sequins, which made them seem so mysterious and magical.

You can find a gypsy skirt pattern online or at your local sewing shop. Just check the section under Halloween costumes. If they don't actually have a gypsy costume, look at the peasant skirts, or the belly dance skirt patterns. For all practical purposes any circle skirt pattern will do. It is this circle cut that makes these skirts flow loosely the way they do. You should be able to find them for most sizes including plus size patterns.

No matter whether you buy one new or used, or make your own, gypsy skirts makes a great fashion statement.
All About Kids Sportswear And Football Pajamas

With Christmas almost here, you might be looking for some unique gift ideas. It's almost a sure thing that growing kids will need hats, pajamas, pants, coats, scarves, gloves, jerseys, sweaters, boots and socks. What parents remark about so frequently is the cost of children's clothing today. Despite being made in Asia or Mexico, the prices for brand name merchandise can set parents back on their heels. Yet so many will fork out the high price for a garment or item that may not be very good quality or which their child will grow out of soon. Worse still is when the child doesn't like the item.

Shoes are high on the shopping priority list, and sports shoes are right up there at number one. It only makes sense, since your kids do walk and run a great deal so good quality and well fitting shoes are a good purchase. They get good value from sports shoes since they wear them for almost every activity, including school and some social functions.

Some people speak poorly of children's appearance these days, yet kids clothes have to last and a child knows their clothing is a little worn and tattered. Some kids have favorite clothes too, and they get some extra wear. In a short time the clothes and shoes look a little shoddy. If you've gotten good value out of them and the child likes them, then who's to complain? Any parent who has purchased a $100 pair of shoes for their youngster always laments that "this has to last." The child nods in agreement yet knows that they probably won't last any longer than the last pair. Beleaguered parents are always looking for relief from the yearly pain of buying kids clothing.

One money saving strategy is to buy clothing items that are durable or can do double duty. There are kids football clothing sets that can double as the child's pajamas. NFL football uniform sets for kids are designed to be comfortable and can be used as kids pajamas. Sports pajamas are very popular and you'll find sports themes from every pro sports league including the NFL, NHL, MLB, NBA, Nascar, and Soccer. These sets come with a kids NFL jersey, pants and a plastic helmet, and you can purchase a set of shoulder pads so the child looks like a football player. There's a number set included too, so you can iron on their favorite player's number. That gives it the personal touch from Mom or Dad.

They can actually do triple duty since they can be used as kids Halloween costumes. Here's one great way to save money and give your child a gift they will appreciate. It's the kind of gift Dad will appreciate too and after all, if Dad likes what his children are wearing, he's going to pay more attention to them and have more fun with them.

So rather than just being a way of covering your child's body, the clothing has an added role of improving self-esteem and making your child more likable. Now brand name clothing manufacturers know all about clothing psychology and they leverage that knowledge well, especially with teenagers. If you have teens, you're well aware of how status conscious they and yet this state is often highly unique. Teens don't always want what everyone else has. They're struggling to discover and establish their own unique identities and want items that reflect that unique identity.

If you buy clothing the child doesn't really like, they won't wear them often and it may even have a bad effect on their self-esteem. Forcing a child to wear items in colors they don't like or styles that are not in tune with their likes and dislikes can lower their mood and energy levels and degrade their performance in school.

To buy the right clothing, think about the sports that kids watch and the teams they talk about. Just by knowing which teams they like, you can avoid buying items that they won't like. If you don't know which football or baseball teams they like, just ask them and ask them what they like about particular features of shoes and jerseys they prefer. Comment on what you like and they might respond with more info on what they like.

Another problem area is sizing. Clothing sizes as reported by manufacturers seem to be way off the mark. Whether it is a just error in judgment or measurement systems used by manufacturers in foreign countries like China, Mexico, or India, or just a type of cost saving strategy by producers here, you need to be sure of your child's measurements. The actual size of the shoes or jersey could be off one size either way. Although you might want to err on the big side to get more life out of a pair of shoes, it could cause them foot and leg problems if they wear them.

To avoid letting them know you're thinking of buying them a new pair of pajamas, you might want to measure them completely all at once and tell them you need the info just in case you find a bargain at the mall somewhere.

All Ladies Love Fashion Jewelry

Every man wonders what gift to buy the special woman in their life and every man should immediately turn to fashion jewelry. Many men believe that women only appreciate jewelry for very special occasions such as a marriage proposals or anniversaries, but fashion jewelry is a great idea for any gift for that special lady in their life. Women love fashion jewelry for many reasons but fundamentally it comes down to having a constant reminder that someone loves them and thinks about them when they are not around.

Fashion jewelry is universally loved by women because it is a way for them to express themselves creatively. Any dress can be made even more special by adding the personal touch of a necklace or brooch. This allows a woman to wear a dress that might be worn by others at the same event but still feel that they stood out in some very meaningful way. When that fashion jewelry was given to them by a loved one, it is made even more special and makes for a great conversation starter when meeting new people.

Jewelry also accents clothing. So a plain dress or blouse can be made to look fantastic with the right jewelry. When a man buys a woman jewelry, he has potentially given her the gift of a handful of new outfit ideas. Every time she wears these old but new outfits, she will think of the man that thought of her and helped save some of her long forgotten and neglected dresses and love him for it.

Women also love jewelry because it is pretty. Every woman has a favorite color or a favorite stone that reminds them of some event or person in their life. Sometimes it is as simple as picking up a ring or necklace that contains a birth stone or finding a stone that is the same color as a favorite shirt. As with every other reason fashion jewelry makes a great gift for women, it all comes down to the fact that women love to feel wanted and considered by the man in their life.

So no matter the occasion, one of the best gifts a man can gift his woman is fashion jewelry. It will provide a surprise that will make a long treasured memory. It is those memories that matter more than anything else in the life of a relationship. It also shows a woman that she is loved well and remove any doubts that her significant other is committed to her. This is especially true when the gift is given for a non-traditional holiday such as Valentine's Day or Christmas. A great holiday to consider giving jewelry is New Year's Eve when a woman often believes that her significant other has already given her all of the gifts on Christmas. It is also a great idea to give jewelry for no reason at all. A "just because" gift can help a woman feel truly appreciated in a relationship and motivate her to return that love.
All You Need To Know About Boudoir Photography

What Is Boudoir Photography?

Historically, the term “Boudoir” was used to describe a lady's dressing room. In the early 1980's “Boudoir photography” was first used to refer to a type of intimate photography. Nowadays, it's quite popular for women to have Boudoir photographs done, usually to surprise that special someone in their life. Boudoir photography sessions can be as varied as each individual. Each person has their unique opinion of what is sensual and beautiful and each photography session and resulting photos reflect that beauty.

What if I don't feel comfortable making Nude Photos?

A Boudoir Photography session should be fun! If you're uncomfortable posing for Nude photographs then don't do them. Every woman is beautiful and sexy. You don't have to take your clothes off to take gorgeous sensual photographs. Working in collaboration with an experienced photographer you can create amazing images clothed, partially clothed or “implied nude” (when the photographer sets the scene so that you appear to be nude but nothing is showing). Communication is key – make sure that you have talked in detail with the photographer about your comfort levels and what your vision is of the finished product and trust that he or she will keep everything hidden that you want hidden. Thanks to modern digital technology it is not difficult to add in extra shadows or use blurring effects to make sure that the finished product is exactly what you want. Keep in mind also that some photographers may not shoot nude photographs, so if you are looking for nude photos ask!

But – I'm too old! I'm too overweight! I'm not pretty enough!

Every woman is beautiful and sexy! Ignore the overly skinny supermodels that you see everyday in advertisements! Real women are all around you and they are all beautiful. Be confident in yourself and your sensual nature. And be confident that your photographer is experienced and can arrange lighting and posing in order to capture “your best side”. 

What do I wear?

Wear what you feel sexy in! A Boudoir Photography session has ample time for several wardrobe changes so bring any outfits you think you might want to wear and any accessories that go with it. Examples include a man's white dress shirt; a baseball jersey and ball cap; lacy nightie; a French maid's costume (great use of old Halloween costumes) and feather duster; plaid mini skirt and white button down shirt and anything else you can imagine! Bring along a suitcase full of outfits. Don't forget high heeled shoes, necklaces, bracelets and other accessories – hats, feather boas, etc. This is a good time to play dress up! Plan out your outfits ahead of time and try them on with different jewelry to see how they look. The photographer may also bring some additional accessories but you should ask about props ahead of time.

What about my Make-up?

Many ladies can do their own make-up but there are other options. Salons and department store make-up counters can be good resources or you can ask your photographer if they have someone they recommend. In most cases the photography studio can contract a make up artist for an additional fee. Don't feel compelled to wear a lot of make-up if it simply isn't your style. 

Where should I have Boudoir Photographs taken?

These are not the kind of images that are on a check list at a mall portrait studio, they need to be personal and intimate. Many women choose a photographer who will come to their home and take photographs in their bedroom. Other women choose to go to the photographer's studio and have their Boudoir session there. These days, though, Boudoir isn't limited to a bedroom setting and lingerie. A number of my own customers have come to me because they were intrigued by my Retro Pinup work. This is yet another option in Boudoir photography.

Nervous? What about a Group Photo Session?

You and three or four of your best girlfriends can get together and do your sessions at the same time. These can be done at the studio, your home or on location and should be approached with a party atmosphere. Each of you will be photographed individually as you are dressed (or undressed) based on each person's comfort level. 
Some photographers (but not all) offer couples sessions. These sessions are romantic, sensual, playful, fun and always tasteful. If you are interested in this type of session make it part of a weekend ‘away' at a local hotel. This leaves you free from distractions and you will have some extra memories of the event.

Retouching

Many photographers include retouching with their portrait prints and albums but be sure to ask how much is included with your session. Most photographers will include minor retouching and color correction as part of their service – after all they want their work to be well represented.

Protecting your privacy

Privacy should be a major concern during your boudoir sessions. All boudoir images are kept in strict confidence and no images will be shown without permission from the client in writing. Make sure your photographer has a privacy policy as well as any professional printers they may use.

Preparing for a Boudoir Photo Session

Wear loose fitting clothing. Avoid tight fitting undergarments as they are the most likely to leave elastic pressure lines on your skin. If you are not doing the session at your home bring as many accessories, outfits and ideas as you can. If you decide to not use everything then it is just a little extra to carry around but its far better then to wish you had brought something.

Ancient Greek Costumes: Masks

Ancient Greek masks were as captivating and intriguing as the culture of ancient Greece itself. The history of these masks dates back to the times of early civilization, when man hunted for his livelihood. Early records of masked creatures, resembling animals, were either drawn or engraved on caves, walls and portrayed in ancient art. 

In ancient times, as the history of masks indicates, the resemblances were often worshiped, especially during hunting and harvest. Ancient people, particularly tribes, dressed themselves up in the likeness of animals in order to beget goodwill from them. They believed this led to triumphant hunts and plentiful harvests. Another reason ancient culture dressed up in masks was for purpose of fertility. 

In movies and theatre, masks were extensively used to add depth to the drama. In the ancient Greek period, the symbol of two masks was used to represent comedy and tragedy - one delightful and the other mournful. In fact, the actors had to wear big masks to intensify their voices. The audiences loved to see characters that were tall and wore huge masks. 

Artists and entertainers largely used masks to enhance their performances, as also their stage presence. They had the ability to become one with the character and reproduce this through appropriate physical action too. These performers put their individualism to one side and really merged with character. Masks were, and still are, particularly admired by children. 

If you wish to decorate your home with historical fantasy, try using Greek decorating themes. Your personal collection of ancient Greek masks and other works of art will give your home a unique touch.

Ancient Greek Male Costume

With the Greek civilization counted as one of the oldest civilizations, it is no surprise that ancient Greek male costume has always been intriguing both for the researchers as well as those who are fascinated by everything Greek'. Though the generally worn costume by most Greek men was a comfortable, tunic-like garment, it was mostly given a shape with a kind of belt. This kind of an ancient Greek male costume was called a chiton. A similar type of this dress was worn by women too, though with an additional covering.

To beat the cold, older men wore draped a blanket like costume, either by itself or over their chitons. Travelers had an added variation to the regular costume worn by ancient Greek males – the Chalmys, which was essentially a small rectangular piece of cloth placed over one of their shoulders.

In Ancient Greece, lead male characters in the Greek theater also had to accentuate their overall costume to make a statement with their audience. They often had to wear shoes with ‘platform' heels to give themselves extra height. In fact, these kinds of shoes were a part of the costume of ancient Greek men, who wanted to avoid the dirt of the streets. Another reason Greek men preferred platform shoes to be an important part of their costume was that young men in particular wanted to attract attention. 

The knowledge about ancient Greek costumes for men would not be complete without a mention of their war ‘helmets', the most recognizable part of a Greek warrior's attire. However, ‘Greek helmets' is not an easy accessory to be described. Unlike the costumes, traditionally, there is no specific helmet to signify the Greek culture. These helmets were of different kinds, namely – trojan, Spartan and Corinthian. Out of these, one of the most admired helmets by collectors is the ‘Trojan war' helmets.

Though the helmets of these ancient Greek men were of different designs, there was an underlying similarity too. The chief difference, however, which differentiated one helmet from the others was - the color of the helmet and the plume. Most of the Trojan helmets of Greeks were in colors like - silver, black, and bronze. Some of them also had a war paint camouflage color. Orange, red, and black were the popular colors of the plumes.

If you want to know the minutest detail of the most historical Trojan helmets, that formed a part of the ancient Greek male costume, especially during war, the black and bronze were the most liked ones. In fact, such a helmet combined with a black or red plume finished up the overall look of the costume. Spartan helmets were another type of helmets that most Greek men liked to go in for.

The basic design of these helmets, like everything else about the ancient Greek male costume, was their evident ‘plainness'. A plain silver-colored helmet, made of iron and steel, was the most loved of all the designs. This particular one was sans the plume. This was worn by the fighters among the ancient Greek men - the Spartan foot soldiers who were the practical force of the Greeks during times of war!

The Cemetery Angel is a full length dress in cement like grey, which creates the ghostly look, wings and lengthy voluminous sleeves. The entire outfit has an unsubstantial quality that conjures up ideas of the supernatural and immaterial.

Some matching face paint to give you a ghostly pallor will make this costume complete - a perfect alternative angel costume.
