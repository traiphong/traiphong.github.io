Being Respectful at a Native American Powwow

The Native American culture is one that is mystical but yet very fascinating. We should be proud that this culture lives among our borders here in America.

They bring so many unique things and blend it with our own culture. Some of these things have gained worldwide notoriety and popularity.

The Native Americans invented the moccasin. The moccasin is an extremely comfortable type of shoe made out of leather or animal skin.

Because of its material, it is really comfy for anyone to wear. This is why it has become popular to wear, even for many other different cultures!

They also invented the tipi, which is a type of household that they used to live in many years ago. Some tribes even use them today to commemorate their ancestors and pay tribute to them.

These houses are usually made of animal skins and are conical in shape. Their shape enables them to be cool in the summer, but yet they can retain heat in the cold winter months.

Another Native American cultural aspect that has been seen and heard all around the world is the powwow. This is an ancient ritual that they do to get together as tribes and celebrate their spirituality.

A powwow usually consists of a lot of music and dancing. It is a sacred ceremony, but not as sacred as other rituals they perform.

Some people may think this ceremony is closed to the public, but it is not! Anybody, regardless of their race and culture can go to one of these amazing ceremonies and see what it has to offer.

A powwow isn't just like any other regular social gathering. Because you've been invited by a tribe and you are in their territory, there are certain rules and guidelines that need to be followed by anyone who attends.

First and foremost, you always need to be respectful whenever you go to a powwow. This is the most important thing you need to remember.

It may look like a social party at times, but to the actual tribe it is a very spiritual gathering and you yourself need to treat it as such. Here are some of the ways that you can pay respect to those who have invited you.

Some rituals, costumes, or mannerisms of the Native Americans may look silly or funny to some people, but you always need to remember to never point at them or make fun of them. This can get you into a lot of trouble!

This doesn't show very much respect, and in a sense you are basically mocking their way of life. If you continue to do this, you will see very quickly that the Native Americans will not want you there!

You also need to remember to not take any pictures unless you have permission from a certain person. Usually, when a formal dance has commenced, you are allowed to take pictures but there are some other times where you are not allowed.

If you see a dancer or someone that is dressed up off by themselves when they are not dancing, you need to ask their permission before you take a picture of them. This could also be very disrespectful if you do it without asking them.

Also remember to never show up at a powwow when you or any of your family members or friends are drunk or high. This is very disrespectful.

Just think if you had a very important party that you were throwing for your friends, and one of your buddies decides to show up at your house drunk and make a ruckus. You would be very offended!

It is the same with the Native American powwow. It is very rude to come onto their property when your mind is not all there.

You might say or do something that will further embarrass the tribe, and even more, it will embarrass you! What's worse, is that you might get in trouble.

If you are caught drinking or using drugs on the premises, you might be escorted out by security and asked never to come back. Do yourself a favor and come to this amazing event totally clean!

Best Man Speech Jokes: How Do You Differentiate a Good Joke from a Not-So-Good One?

Standing behind the groom as he waits for his bride in the altar is what a best man normally does. But added to this very simple task comes a not so effortless one – the best man speech. 

In a wedding, the speech of the best man is one of the most anticipated parts of the program. Of course, it won't be complete without best man speech jokes to provide the formal celebration with a touch of laid back and fun atmosphere. But how do you exactly define a good joke from a bad one? This article will help you uncover the strategies of making the celebration light and bubbly without the need for some comical offensive remarks. 

The first rule in giving best man speech jokes are to make certain that you keep your comic stories as clean as possible. Even if you're close to the groom or the bride and you know they can stand your funny jokes, it still pays to make everything wholesome enough for everybody to contain. Sometimes, best men would be so complacent that they often loose themselves while delivering their jokes in their speech. So, instead of making the whole event lively, you end up having spiteful and intriguing grins from those who witnessed and heard your claim. 

The next rule is to take into account the presence of children and elders in the event. Will your jokes be suitable for kids? Will these comic strips be acceptable to elders? These are some of the things you have to consider in making your best man speech. Apart from this, you also have to consider the feelings of the parents and relatives of the newly wed.  So the question is, how can you deliver best man speech jokes without rubbing the wrong way and hurting somebody's feelings? Here are few things to do:

1. Think of a funny story (this can be a personal experience with the bride or groom or your own story). From there, try to tell the story in a funny and decent way. Taking your funny jokes for a speech from a personal experience can appear natural and effortless. 

2. Familiarity and timing is salient. Practicing your best man speech jokes is necessary but you have to ensure that you don't deliver it in your practice as often as possible. Let it flow naturally and ascertain that proper timing is also well taken into account. 

3. Do you know that practicing the joke until it doesn't appeal to you anymore is a sign of efficiency? This simply means that when the time you deliver it in the big day, the joke will come out inherent and unpretentious. 

4. Just as jokes play imperative in delivering your best man speech, remember to do away with obscene and malicious tall stories and teasers. 

As a final note, enjoy the whole experience. Being best man for a wedding is an honor so you have to bring back the privilege and respect by delivering a heartfelt, sincere, funny but decent best man speech.
Best Necklace Materials

Many of today's costume necklaces reflect the wide variety of materials and styles available from a world market. The composition and craftsmanship of the designs can easily “make” an outfit by creating a focal point for the eye. Still, the most basic elements of a decorative necklace are what entice the eye and appeal to the wearer.

Wooden Bead Designs

Originally hand carved, these beads come in a wide variety of sizes, shapes, and colors. Wooden designs are among the trendiest choices in materials, as they are “green.” This renewable material also comes in numerous shapes, sizes, and finishes. Likewise, costly wood such as mahogany and ebony are quite affordable in necklace form. Today's wooden beads are crafted with laser precision and high tech finishes that make them beautiful as well as durable.

Shell Designs

Shell gives jewelry an exotic, yet casual look. Small cowries embedded into braided hemp or leather make necklaces relaxed, yet fashionable. Shells often are grouped into cascades for pendants or affixed using small loops as dangles. Oftentimes, this component comes from oceans and seas around the world, with particular areas specializing in certain types of shells.

Shell is also a valuable source material for other necklace components. Mother of pearl is carefully cut from mollusks; while abalone's beautiful iridescent layer provides an ideal material for crafting a variety of shapes to give depth and dimension to necklaces. Coral makes for brilliant beading materials, and Puka shells from the Pacific look wonderful strung together.

Glass Bead Designs

Glass beads come from the world-over and their use dates back for centuries. Long strands of uniform, overlapping seed beads create a lush effect. Whether monochromatic or in a variety of colors, glass beads offer eye-catching results. Many artists today also opt for glass bead cascades in a variety of lengths and bead sizes for a fun and funky look.

Originally, glass beads were hand blown; although, many of today's beads are manufactured for uniformity and accuracy. Italian Milliefiore beads make for colorful additions to today's necklaces as well. Glass for this particular style of bead is folded to form ornate designs that add interest and catch the eye.

Metal Bead Designs

Metal beads date back centuries and were originally made from soft, pliable metals. Today, with the help of presses and molds, metal beads come in an array of sizes and styles. Because of the versatility of metal, it can be etched with designs by artisans, heat finished, acid washed, and brushed. Metal remains a favorite of jewelry craftsmen the world over.

Charms and pendants are most often metallic in origin and today's costume jewelry often utilizes such design elements as the focus or inspiration for the entire necklace. Soft metals and precious metals play an important role in the creation of charms and pendants.

Resin and Polymer Bead Designs

Today's jewelry artists recognize the advantages of resin and polymer ornamentation on necklaces. The materials enable designers to utilize a wide variety of colors and textures while keeping designs light-weight and cost effective. Resin and polymer beads can be molded as well as carved, and often times, they mimic much more costly ornamentation at a fraction of the price.

Bone Bead Designs

Bone beads are made from animals such as sheep and cows. Sometimes these materials are bleached and dyed for interest and variety. Quality bone jewelry wears well and is long lasting. As a design material, craftsmen across the globe enjoy its ability to be carved into a variety of shapes. Bone is also a sustainable resource that gives an earthy quality to necklace designs.

Birthday Party Themes for Your Kid

On the web there are literally hundreds of ideas for party themes.

But some of the best ones come from people who know how to work with kids, day in and day out.

For instance, you could hire a local magician.  It sounds rather obvious and many parents would say that's "old hat."

But the fact is, it is not old hat to the kids attending the party.  It will be brand new for them and they will be amazed if the magician is any good.

For instance, at my daughter's party I hired a magician.  He was young and rather inexperienced and frankly he was rather inexpensive.

But he wanted to make sure my daughter and her friends had a good time.  He spent the time and effort, even though his magic was mediocre.

But there was one magic trick he did.  I was amazed.  

He made my daughter levitate.  I couldn't believe it.

It stole the show and other parents wanted him to come and perform at their kid's next birthday party.

The best part is that the magician actually taught our kids how to do magic.  No, not everything but enough where they were fascinated and were trying all sorts of simple tricks on each other.

That's what made the party special.  It was a magic theme.

Now maybe your daughter or son isn't into magic.  That's ok.  Maybe your daughter is into fairies.  I mean what little girl wouldn't be.

You could have a fairy themed party.  Where they make or draw fairies.  Or they dress up as fairies.  You could have the birthday cake decorated with fairies.

It's just a matter of using your imagination.

The key and actually the best part is involving your son or daughter in the selection process and the preparation.  Sure they may not be as adept, but it's their party and they will want it a certain way no matter how young or old they are.

The Perfect Birthday Party

Every child should have a birthday party at least once in their life. It is important to make a child known that he is special enough to celebrate important milestones in his life and having a birthday party is one such way to make him feel special, the more well thought up the birthday party will be, the better. You don't have to be a birthday party expert to think up of birthday party ideas.

Kids adore magic. This is why hiring a good birthday party magician who can perform a good birthday magic show is well worth your money. You'll be sure that your child and his guests will enjoy his party. 

Themes are also another way to make a kid's birthday party more colorful. If your child is a girl then a fantasy party will suit her quite well (with her being the queen or princess of course). If your child is a boy, you can give a fantasy party as well, but this time be generous with the knights and dragons. If your child is particularly fond of a television show or a cartoon character then a cartoon themed party would also be fun. If you are going to invite a birthday party magician it would go well with a Harry Potter themed party. It doesn't matter if you are hiring a Virginia magician or a Maryland magician so long as he fills the part well. 

Games and prizes are essential in making a good birthday party. You can play any old game but you should change a few aspects of the game to suit the theme. For instance instead of a trip to Jerusalem, why not call it a 'trip to Hogwarts?' Anything can be made to fit the theme of your child's party. You just have to be imaginative. You should also incorporate the use of a pinata. Children love pinatas. 

Don't forget to make your party suitable for the age of your child. If, for instance, you are hosting a party for a three year old, maybe certain games and themes aren't suitable for your child. 

 Serve food that your kid likes. Unfortunately this would entail fried foods and sweets. Make an exception for his special day. After all you have to make his day special. Unfortunately, some of your child's favorite food might also be messy to eat, not to mention the fact that kids are naturally messy no matter what they eat. For this reason, you should prepare for a big clean up after the party. Expect to clean up a lot of wrapping paper, litter and leftover food. 

Remember to have fun when you are organizing your child's party. Tap the inner child in you and imagine what you would have wanted in your party when you were your child's age. Ask your child what he wants for his party and make it fit your budget. And if you do get tired from organizing your party, be thankful that it just comes once a year.
Black Leather Corset - The Biggest Revival

It is evident that the black leather corset is one of the most elegant forms of lingerie that you can buy. It is elegant and creates that dramatic look that makes women look and feel more feminine but it is also one of the oldest forms of lingerie in existence. It has been around for hundreds of years and it has provided the slimming effect and bust lifting that most women look for in leather lingerie. These leather corsets will flatter your figure and give you that alluring and seductive look. 

The texture and smell of leather are very sensual, so it's not surprising that someone would eventually join the sensuality of leather with the provocative nature of lingerie. Black leather corset comes in a wide variety of styles from which you can choose the perfect outfit for you.

Leather corsets are an icon from the past that are seeing a modern resurgence and you will find they have never lost their appeal to the opposite sex! The corset is a garment that has undergone many changes over the years. Originally, the garment we now know as the corset was known as stays in the early 16th century. It was a simple bodice, with tabs at the waist, stiffened by horn, buckram, and whalebone.

Corsets were originally quilted waistcoats, worn by French women as an alternative to stiff corsets. They were only quilted linen, laced in the front, and un-boned. This garment was meant to be worn on informal occasions, while stays were worn for court dress. In the 1790s, stays fell out of fashion. This development coincided with the French Revolution. 

Stays went away in the late 18th century, but the corset remained. Corsets in the early 19th century lengthened to the hip, the lower tabs replaced by gussets at the hip. Room was made for the bust in front with more gussets, and the back lowered. The shoulder straps disappeared in the 1840s for normal wear. In the 1820s, fashion changed again and corsets began to be made with some padding and boning. Leather corsets began to be worn by all classes of society.

During the Edwardian period, the straight front corset was introduced. This corset was straight in front, with a pronounced curve at the back that forced the upper body forward, and the derrière out. The leather corset reached its longest length in the early 20th century. The corset fell from fashion in the 1920s in Europe and America, replaced by girdles and elastic brassieres, but survived as an article of costume.

In recent years, the term "corset" has also been borrowed by the fashion industry to refer to tops which, to varying degrees mimic the look of traditional corsets without actually acting as one. Since the late 1980s, the corset has experienced periodic revivals but the strongest took place with the release of the film Moulin Rouge, the costumes for which featured many corsets as characteristic of the era.

Since then, other films have used these garments as costume features, generally to suggest a period effect, as in Van Helsing, where Anna Valerious wears a leather under bust corset as part of her costume. One distinctive feature has been to portray them in combination with catsuits, as in Star Trek: Voyager where Seven of Nine throughout the series wears catsuits with contained built-in corsets, or Underworld, where Selene wears a black leather corset over matching latex catsuit. Many fashion magazines front pages feature over bust and under bust black leather corsets and celebrities such as Victoria Beckham, Jennifer Aniston, Paris Hilton and many more are seen wearing these sensual and provocative lingerie to fashion shows, dinners and celebrity parties. 

If you're not sure which sexy black leather corset to buy, then look at our online store -  - you're sure to find exactly what you had in mind, or perhaps even something more scintillating than what you'd originally envisaged!

Because this stone can get scratched or it can chip rather easily, it is better to wrap it in a cloth when storing it in your jewellery box.
Blood Capsules As a Costume Prop

A costume is not just about getting the right accessories. For a genuinely scary costume, people would have to put effort in finding makeup that would work well with the overall appeal of their costume. Perhaps it would be confusing for people who never really tried to experiment with makeup. Those people can ask for help from those who have had experience in using stage makeup.

It is not just about the foundation, the eyeliner or the basic types of makeup. Makeup for Halloween costumes needs to be more noticeable and more defined. It might be better if people resorted to using face paint rather than depend on multiple applications of the subtle colors of everyday makeup. After the base, that would be the time to put on the final touches to make it seem scarier. Because it is for a scary costume, blood capsules are probably the most useful fancy makeup this season.

Basically, a blood capsule is a costume prop. People need to bite into it to let fake blood ooze out of the mouth. This is often used along with zombie costumes, vampire costumes and other gruesome costumes. Actually, just about any Halloween fancy dress can be turned more ghastly with one. For example, a bear costume will be more fitting for the Halloween with streaks of blood coming out of the mouth. The same is applicable in an Egyptian costume. A bit of pale makeup, washable blood on the costume and dried blood on the mouth will make a Cleopatra costume look horrifying. It really depends how scary people want their costumes to be.

This is not only to be used for scary costumes. Sexy adult ensembles can also be made more fitting for the Halloween theme if they have those red marks around the mouth. For example, a teenager who already owns a playboy bunny costume does not have to get a new costume if the host demanded a scary one. A bit of experimentation and they can turn the otherwise seductive costume into a macabre ensemble. They can start with using pale foundation all over. This can be done by mixing white and mint green face paint. People can also use the green tint foundation if they do not have face paint but it would be quite expensive to use those. They can also add fake wounds and scars that can also be bought in Halloween specialty shops. Just before they head to the venue, they can bite into the capsule and make the outfit complete. Some even put dried blood on their hair.

It would be up to the person how much blood they want. If they want the detail to be more subtle then they can opt to bite only one or two capsules. On the other hand, if they wish to look seriously bloody, they can bite into six or more capsules with fake blood. Halloween accessories as such can spell more fun for youngsters and their playmates. Parents can also get extra capsules so that the kid can give them to other kids who are naturally curious.
Boo! A Halloween Summary of To Kill a Mockingbird

For many, Halloween is the time to brave the consumer crowds, dress up like our favorite villains and superheroes, and invest in a dental plan. For those of us who are too old (or too sober) to put on a Halloween costume, however, this is the perfect time to curl up by the radiator and indulge in a scary story.
Harper Lee's American classic To Kill a Mockingbird may not be the first thing that springs to mind, but if you strip the story of its youthfully innocent narration and happy summertime exploits, the plot is downright creepy.
The story centers around "Boo" Radley, the neighborhood shut-in who allegedly earned his imprisonment by stabbing his father with a pair of scissors. Unsurprisingly, the townschildren try to avoid the Radley place for fear of being seen/abducted/barbecued by the prisoner, who hasn't gone out in public for decades. The story's heroine/narrator, "Scout" Finch, is therefore none too thrilled when her older brother and best friend begin obsessing over Boo, making plans to investigate his lair and telling ghoulish stories about his crimes. That's enough to make any 6-year old want to change the bedsheets.
Worse yet, Boo begins to leave "offerings" for the Finch kids to find as they pass his house on their way to school every day. These range from seemingly innocent (but potentially deadly) trifles like chewing gum to painstakingly carved and terrifyingly accurate soap figurines of - you guessed it - the Finches themselves. (Nothing says "trustworthy" like carving children in your free time.) When a neighbor's house burns down in the middle of the night, Scout, who is watching the disaster unfold on the street, suddenly realizes that Boo has draped a blanket over her shivering shoulders - and that she didn't even notice he was behind her.
While Boo's ghostlike ability to pass unnoticed through the night gives Scout plenty of food for thought, the real horror story begins when Tom Robinson, a crippled black local, is wrongfully charged with - and convicted of - raping a white woman. In case you like your tragedy with a twist of irony, the woman only accuses him after having been caught making some serious moves on the guy. Then, when Tom tries to escape from prison, he is shot no less than seventeen times.
Scout's father, Atticus Finch unsuccessfully represents Tom in court, earning him the animosity of the townspeople and outright hatred of the so-called victim's father, Bob. In a drunken fit, Bob attacks the Finch children on their way home from the Halloween pageant. Luckily, Scout's sizeable ham costume - not to mention, the miraculous intervention of Boo Radley - save her from Bob's knife, leaving her brother unconscious but only mildly injured. Bob is later found dead on the street, and those in the know agree to call the death "accidental" to protect Boo.
The end of this To Kill a Mockingbird summary and the Finches' fateful encounter with the not-actually-all-that-scary Boo Radley teach us a valuable lesson: if you do decide to partake in the Halloween activities, don't let your imagination get the best of you. But bring a ham costume just in case.

Bridge Jewelry the Affordable Alternative

Jewelry is more than an accessory; it can be a promise, a remembrance, a statement or a frivolous decoration.  Fine jewelry, Bridge jewelry and Costume Jewelry all contribute to the choices you make as you create your look.  The terms Bridge jewelry and Artisan jewelry are sometimes used as if they are synonymous.  This is a misconception. 

Fine jewelry is generally thought of as jewelry that uses at least 14 kt. Gold or other precious metals and precious gems like diamonds, sapphires, rubies or emeralds.  Fine jewelry can be mass-produced or artisan-made one-of-a-kind pieces or limited-edition. 

Costume jewelry can also be artisan-made or mass produced.  Materials used in the designs are base metals, glass, plastic and other synthetics.  They also may use shell, wood and other organic materials.

Bridge jewelry is called that because it is the bridge between Fine jewelry and Costume jewelry.  It may use vermeil, gold filled or silver as the metal and uses semi precious stones such as amethyst, citrine, turquoise, jade, topaz, fresh water pearls, garnet and others.  Much Bridge jewelry is artisan-made, but it can also be mass produced.

Of course other combinations such as using precious metals like 14k gold with amethyst are used and not so easily classified.  Price points are another way to define the three types of jewelry with Fine jewelry as the most expensive and Costume jewelry as an inexpensive alternative.  Bridge jewelry falls between these two on price.

Bridge jewelry is a unique addition to your jewelry collection. You may see some familiar names in galleries or fine department stores and begin to recognize them as producers of Bridge jewelry.  When you attend an art show, take a special look at the jewelry and you will recognize that much of it is fine artisan-made Bridge jewelry.  It can provide you a good value because of the combination of quality materials; creativity and workmanship provided by the designers of these unique one-of-a-kind or limited edition pieces.

Burlesque Corsets: Find the best Burlesque Costumes and Moulin Rouge Costumes Online

Burlesque is the great reason to slip on a fantastic corset in full show. Corsets donned as under garments can be very attractive but you'll have to make sure that lace or frills or any adornment will not get in the way with the dress being worn over it. With burlesque on the other hand, the whole point is to showcase the body and the corset also. What this means is you can go for amazing styles

The corset is the main element of burlesque costumes. Slimming the waist by 2 – 4 inches, the corset truly makes the most of the feminine figure, giving it the perfect hourglass shape. And the charm of the corset and the shapely look it achieves, is that it's sexy and feminine for all figures. For thinner figures a corset emphasizes the bust and for larger figures the corset certainly makes the majority of all your assets!

Corsets had been used by women all throughout the ages – think Elizabethan period with the massive crinoline skirts where they used to get sewed into their dresses; the Edwardian times with the beautiful bustles; the Victorian period where smelling salts were always present simply because of the firmly cinched waists; the saloon girl clothings of the wild west, and of course the excellent corsets highlighted in the burlesque acts of the 1800s to today.

A good quality corset is an investment. It can also be put on with a long taffeta or velvet skirt as a cocktail dress (or black tie depending upon the custom of the event), it could be worn with jeans to a club or worn in a full burlesque costume for fancy dress or for a bit of enjoyment at home!

And naturally, it's not just about how one can put it on, it's how it causes you to truly feel. A corset will emphasise your figure and create a perfect silhouette that'll allow you to look and feel sexy.

Major features to check for in a really good corset are:

• The boning – steel is generally endorsed as the most effective for their flexibleness and sturdiness.

• Back panels (they are often optional but a great idea should you not want your skin appearing on the lacing)

• The lacing – it must be accurate corset lacing, not merely a ribbon if you really would like to have the full effect.

Normal proportions usually give you a variance of 8 – 10? between bust and waist and 10 – 12? between waist and hips. If you are not a standard size you can get made to measure corsets.

The cloth you choose will even make a big difference. Satin corsets are smooth and the fabric keeps its form well, leather corsets allows for a bit of stretch and heavier fabrics such as brocade have very little give at all.

For people with a smaller bust you choose a corset with additional ornament across the bust for example , frills or feathers and pair it with a frilly skirt, or frilly knickers with fishnets under a tutu.

For curvier figures keep the decoration on the corset to a minimum and slip on a bustle skirt or a bustle train over a short skirt to really stress the hourglass figure.

And should you have a large bust choose an underbust corset to cinch the waist but that enables you to wear a bra that fits correctly. You can wear an underbust corset over a dress or a basic shirt.

Burlesque Performances

And lastly burlesque doesn't always just mean red and black and striptease. Burlesque is primarily based on a comedy or variety show and many of the most widley known performing artists have elegant stage personas as well as acts… as well as corsets to match!

No matter whether the act or theme is a devil, a mermaid, a ringmaster, a dancer or maybe a vampire the elegant corsets are always a key piece of the outfit. And while burlesque often does involve some clothing removal, in most shows this is simply a tease… removing stockings and gloves in a slow and sensuous way is a standard part of any act.

A lot of corsets are certainly not made to generally be stripped away quickly! And many of us are on the lookout for corsets to wear to clubs or fancy dress parties so removing them is not an issue, but if you happen to looking for a bit of the tease factor then pick one with a zip either front or back.

A good corset could also be worn underneath a jacket with jeans or with a long skirt for a black tie event. Corsets areundeniably back in fashion so consider the excuse to highlight your femininity!
Burlesque Costumes - A Brief History

Suddenly burlesque and pinup fashions are all over the Internet. The original burlesque designs with their risqué overtones have become the fun fashion, being adapted and adopted by rockabilly. Almost every city now hosts regular burlesque events where not just the performers, but the audience gets to dress the part as well.

Origins of burlesque - lingerie on show!

The word burlesque probably derives from the French, which describes a piece of slightly outrageous, humorous art. The term burlesque originally applied to shows intended for middle or lower classes. Such shows lampooned upper class niceties and parodying upper class entertainments like opera & dance. Such music and comedy shows and plays grew in popularity on both sides of the Atlantic during the nineteenth century. In Victorian England, where even "a glimpse of stocking was looked on as something shocking", burlesque challenged its audience by offering rather more than a "glimpse of stocking" - the lure of young ladies appearing in tights and lingerie! Certainly demure by today's standards these slightly suggestive interludes certainly boosted the popularity of burlesque. Lydia Thompson took a burlesque troupe, called the British Blondes to New York near the end of the 1860s where they were an immediate hit. At first they were feted by the press, but before long strident voices, from the pulpit and the papers were complaining of loose morals and indecency. The result of all this adverse publicity was to spread the word about burlesque far and wide in America effectively having the reverse effect to that desired by burlesque's critics - female burlesque troupes with close copies of the original British act sprung up around the country.

These shows owed a great deal of their structure to the minstrel shows of the time and generally consisted of three parts - the initial section featuring the ladies, the middle section was a mix of male comedians and specialty acts and the final part the grand finale. Copying Lydia Thompson's lead, most of the troupes had female managers. However towards the end of the nineteenth century, as male managers took over, they switched the emphasis away from comedy to push boundaries, determined to show as much uncovered female flesh as the laws would allow.

This form of entertainment metamorphosed in the early twentieth century into a mix of music hall, satire and striptease. During the twenties the bias continued inexorably towards striptease and away from the accompanying elements. This shift doubtlessly was burlesque's downfall; by the thirties the popularity of burlesque dropped away probably reacting against what had become slightly tawdry striptease shows. Local authorities were no longer as tolerant of this entertainment, which had lost much of its music hall variety flavor.

New Burlesque

In the mid nineteen nineties the genre was resurrected, with troupes in the USA, and the trend has snowballed over to the UK. Now, once more on both sides of the channel, it is possible to see shows equal in glamour, bawdiness and variety to equal the art form in its heyday in clubs and theatres in major cities. Arguably the Internet has played a major part to spread the interest in the genre. There are websites, such as Ministry of Burlesque dedicated to promoting it, to teaching dance, makeup and fashion.

Burlesque lingerie fashion

The mainstay of this style is lingerie and modern burlesque generally concentrates on the fifties and to a lesser degree the forties look. This extends not only to clothing, but hats, footwear and makeup too. There have always been fans of fifties silk and nylon stockings. The majority stocking mills closed up shop when pantyhose all but killed the stocking market. Their huge stocking machines were destroyed and along with it the expertise to manufacture fully-fashioned stockings. Now the rare machines remaining are being rebuilt and returned to service to again produce faux fifties seamed stockings. However a few companies trading online still have limited supplies of the original fifties stockings so the purists can satisfy their need to the 'real thing' rather than the modern copies. Sadly, once that depleting stock is exhausted, they will only be viewable in museums and private collections.

However, for burlesque stage performance it is the fishnet tights or pantyhose that are still really popular.

Companies are making exact copies both of retro costumes and burlesque accessories, from ostrich feather fans to bullet bras. Lingerie companies, sensing an opportunity not to be missed, are enticing well-known burlesque artists to lend their names and expertise to burlesque-inspired lingerie designs.

Burlesque is eagerly embraced by all physiques, from plus size to skinny-minny, proving how empowering it can be to women - all physiques are equally welcomed, but there is not set 'burlesque costume' either. It is very common for burlesque artists to take everyday lingerie, adapt it by sewing on sequins to devise their own unique take on burlesque. However the common thread that runs through the new outfits, going right back to the earliest days of the art form is the element of 'tease', the showing of rather more lingerie and stocking tops that would normally be seen in everyday life.

Rockabilly fashion

Over the years a number of fashion styles have grown towards each other, oft times overlapping. The word rockabilly was used around the mid forties and was a blend of hillbilly and rock and roll music styles. Todays pinup photographers generally recreate the stylish fifties imagery which overlaps but is distinct from rockabilly. Many rockabilly enthusiasts have tattoos and piercings, and that certainly was never a fad of the fifties, but a modern phenomenon.

Pinup fashion

The term pinup also has blurred origins, covering photos of movie stars from around the thirties and forties, but also the airbrushed fantasy women gracing men's magazines by such exponents as Petty and Elvgren. The fashions often featured nylons and lingerie, sometimes being exposed by a sudden unexpected gust of wind or other 'mishap' that befell the model. The intention was actually to reveal very very little by today's standards. It is a certainty that pinup art, with the sexy lingerie has strongly influenced the outfits adopted by many of today's burlesque artists.
