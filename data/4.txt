Assembling the Right Ladies Medieval Halloween Costume

Wondering what to be for this Halloween? Perhaps you should consider a medieval costume. This is a great idea, as it doesn't matter if you're looking for a petite outfit or a plus size medieval costume. And, with the right accessories, your outfit can stand out from the crowd.

Most woman's outfit involve a gown or skirt, and the type usually defines the outfit. One piece dresses can be great for queens and princesses, and skirts paired with bodices and chemises can work for saucy tavern wenches and common peasant girls. 

If you're choosing to be royal, look for costumes online that offer trim that looks like what we imagine royalty would wear: gold, brocade, velvet, or lace looking trims give the illusion of a moneyed background, which is what you're going for. When you look for a Halloween costume, whether it's online or in person, see if it comes with a tiara of some sort. Often there's a crown or hat that will help show you're not a commoner.

For a great finishing touch, costume jewelry full of large, sparkling gems is a must. If you don't want to break the bank, check out second hand stores. Often, the jewelry is in display cases or under the counter, so you might have to ask to see some of it. Don't be shy! Why pass up that beautiful red gems choker just because you're too nervous to ask to see it?

Tavern wenches and commoners are another type of medieval outfit women can wear for Halloween. These outfit are usually simpler in trim, although the costume themselves may have more pieces. Most wench don't have large strands of jewels, or clutch purses, so make yourself stand out by your simplicity. If you can, try layering two skirts of different contrasting colours, or pairing a coloured chemise under a solid coloured bodice and skirt. Or, use a bright coloured bodice with a dark skirt and light chemise.

If you must accessorize, consider using hairstyle held up with fancy hair pins or clips. A simple necklace of a thin gold chain and a locket would also work. Use a lotion with shimmer in it, and brush it on your shoulders, cleavage (if it shows), and cheekbones â€“ pretty much anywhere the light will hit you. Use shimmery eyeshadow to highlight your eyes, or bold lipstick. You don't need many accessories to pull off the tavern wench, use yourself!

If your hair is short and you feel it will detract from your costume, try a medieval costume wig. There are a number of affordable, good looking wigs out there at many costume shops on and offline. For fun, try a hair colour different than your own. Go light if you're dark haired, or try a saucy red wig. Everyone loves red hair. The possibilities are varied with a wig and accessories.

Attic Ladders – Get Access To That Crawlspace Or Attic

Many houses have unfinished attics, areas above the garage, or other unfinished crawlspaces that are not easily accessible. In many cases there is no room anywhere for a stair case, yet the space could be used for storage or perhaps even to create a new and additional living space.

At attic ladder can be used to access these areas. These are commercial devices you can buy online or at home improvement and hardware stores. They are folding ladders/stairs that can be used to access these types of areas that completely retract and are out of the way, folded into the ceiling, when not in use. 

Installation requires cutting an appropriately sized hole in the ceiling and inserting/attaching these in place. Different type openings are available, although standard openings are around 22" by 54”. Smaller ones for restricted spaces are available too. You can buy them for ceiling of various heights as well, ranging from less than 8 feet to about 12 feet high.

Our attic ladder allows us to access our unfinished yet large attic space. We use it both for longtime and seasonal storage, freeing up other storage space in the rest of our house. When we need access, we merely pull down and unfold the ladder.

Depending on how handy you are, you may be able to install one yourself. I probably could have as it is not that difficult, but didn't feel conformable cutting a hole in the ceiling, so I hired a handyman who did it quickly and inexpensively.

Batman The Ultimate Superhero Costume

Batman is the ultimate superhero from the comics, all the way into the realm of the modern movie era. He originated in D.C. Comics and was one of its most important comic heroes of all time. His character has been played by several different actors over the years in the movies, along with being directed by multiple directors also. It is argued that Batman maybe undefinable to make that perfect movie version of his tale. Something about Batman is very hard to pin down and capture cinematically, at least to the fans. His influence is amazingly broad and more than any other comic book superhero, he represents the human side of heroes from the comic book genre. He was more human than superhero in his purpose, in his friendships and his personal life. He also is defined by the batman costume which is one of the most excellent Mens superhero costumes of all time. 

Batman had a purpose that was defined by the death of his parents early in life. He is more of a vigilante than a true superhero, being that his motivation for fighting crime is to seek vengeance against the killers of his parents. This becomes the hidden crutch that makes Batman more human that other superheroes. He also has no natural super powers, as Bruce Wayne he has the resources to invent devices that make him powerful but nothing more. He has not magic or supernatural endowments. He is a human, with weapons, tactics, high powered vehicles and a utility belt full of tricks. 

Batman had only very secret friendships, but the closest ends up being with the boy wonder Robin. Batman has a some small personal world, but never a life that can be separated from his identity as the Dark Knight. He has love briefly, has family that he loses and even his own identity must be sacrificed, if he is to eventually achieve his primary goal. The goal of taking vengeance on his parents killer is always at the forefront of his life, even as he fights the world of crime by night. On some level, Batman is not so different than the criminals that he hunts and stalks by cover of darkness. He is a superhero, but internally more like a waiting vampire that only has yet to find its true prey. This is where all of us can relate to Batman a little, we all are a bit torn between what is right and what we desire to be. Justice and purpose are in conflict within Batman. 

Another aspect all unto itself was the exterior that made the man into a superhero, the costume he wore. The Batman costume is unique among superhero costumes. It is one of the best designed mens superhero costumes and has no rivals. The batman costume is the standard by which almost all mens superhero costumes are put up against. Before Batman most mens superhero fancy dress were only a piece of wardrobe, mens superhero costumes generally had no function other than looks. But Batman had a costume with devices, tools, a utility belt and other secrets. It was body armour, allowed manoeuvrability and had a cape that was the key to low level flight ability. It also was a form of camouflage in darkness and was undeniably recognizable.
Batman's Biggest Adversaries

Like any other respectable superhero, Batman has had his fair share of enemies. Considering that it is almost seventy years since the creation of 'The Caped Crusader' you can imagine that to comprise a detailed dossier of each and every foe that Batman has faced would be a mammoth task.

Instead of listing all of his adversaries to date (most of whom few of us would ever have heard of) it would probably be more interesting to mention the most dangerous and infamous.

First up is, of course, The Joker. Out of all of the characters to create misery for Batman he must take first place. The Joker, name aside, is not to be taken lightly. He is a worthy opponent of Batman and is extremely unpredictable and dangerous. Jack Nicholson did a great job of playing the character in 1989's 'Batman' but it has to be said that the late Heath Ledger probably bettered him if only for the dark and downright disturbing edge that he brought to the role in 2008's 'The Dark Knight'.

Next up is The Penguin, so named because of his appearance and its similarity to the Antarctic bird. With his long, beak-like nose and squat body he is a rather repulsive character. He is, however, a very intelligent man. He sees himself as a 'higher being' but he is also very much of an outcast. In the sixties 'Batman' series he was portrayed by Burgess Meredith but of the actors that have played the role Danny DeVito got it down to a tee in 1992's 'Batman Returns'. While we are on the subject of that movie there is also Catwoman to mention. Who could forget Michelle Pfeiffer's sexy slant on the P.V.C. clad villainess? The character had already been portrayed very well by the late Eartha Kitt twenty-five years previously. Who is the rightful queen of that part is debatable.

Then there is The Riddler. Between 1967 and 1968 during the 'Batman' series the character was played by both Frank Gorshin and John Astin. In 1995 Jim Carrey became The Riddler for 'Batman Forever'. The Riddler, as his name suggests, is obsessed with riddles. He frequently sends complicated clues to both Batman and the police before committing a crime. The Riddler is always dressed in a green outfit with a domino mask. A lot of the time he is accompanied by two female accomplices named Echo and Query.

Our last enemy of Batman is Mister Freeze. He first appeared in Detective Comics as 'Mister Zero' and wasn't a particularly dangerous character. However, after appearing in the 'Batman' series of the sixties on several different occasions he became 'Mister Freeze', a far more serious threat to our hero. He is a mad scientist who just so happens to have a great understanding of cryonics. To survive anywhere except for a special refrigeration unit, Mister Freeze is forced to wear a special suit to keep him sufficiently cold. His suit gives him superhuman strength and he uses weapons of his own invention that harness cold in destructive ways. In 1997's 'Batman and Robin' he was played by the well cast Arnold Schwarzenegger.

So, as you can see, Batman has his work cut out. And remember...these are just a few of many, many more.
Be a Showstopper at your Dance Competition

When it comes to a dance competition, don't leave anything to chance.

There are many career paths for dancers, including Broadway and choreographers, among others. One path of a dancer is dance competitions. This article has some basic dance tips that will build you up to be a dance competition showstopper. As always, I've consulted with my entertainment industry pals (i.e. they vent to me while I go temporarily insane), and I have written this article with their “suggestions” in mind.

Before the Dance Competition:
This tip should be followed way before you get to your competition. It's obvious, but some people, who get too big too fast, may come to the conclusion that they know best…that's called ignorance (I also have some other words for it). Listen, learn and listen again to your coach / teacher / mentor. Whoever is training you probably knows a little something about dance competitions and should be taken seriously. This is assuming you've hired an experienced, knowledgeable person, and not your uncle who gets his expertise from watching his extended DVD version of “Step Up”.

Just Before the Dance Competition:
Before you go sky diving, play tackle football or any other activity that could potentially set your dancing career back a few years if you get hurt, don't do it. Yeah, let's train all year and just before the big dance competition I'll go skiing and sprain my ankle, break my elbow or worse. Being a good performing artist is not all about discipline within your art, but also within your personal life. The decisions you make outside your dance studio can adversely affect your ability to dance inside the studio. The sooner you learn that, the better.

It's also important to take a breather before you go out and perform. I remember when I was preparing for a test in college, I used to take a break from my studies and let it all sink in just before the exam. Learning choreography is very similar to studying for a test. You study your choreography until you do it in your sleep. It's important to give your mind a rest, so that when you get out there you don't look robotic or simply draw a blank from exhaustion. Giving yourself a rest will allow you to truly perform the routine and not just go through the motions like a zombie who's been training nonstop.

For the Dance Competition:
Dancing, like acting and any performing art, is all about making the audience feel something. When your emotion is felt by the individuals watching you perform, you know you are a great dancer. Getting to this point means understanding the movements you are performing, becoming familiar with the music, and coming up with compelling dance choreography. The end product should have varying levels of contrast between the opening and climax so the audience can perceive and appreciate the differences. The choreography itself should be interesting to a broad audience. To accomplish this, try being creative and have fun with it. Combine different genres and styles of music and dance. Tap dance to hip hop music. Bring people together who normally wouldn't be attending the same event.

During the Dance Competition:
In any performance, confidence and presentation is key. You have no reason to be afraid or ashamed so there is no need to project that feeling to the judges or audience. Just have your head up, make eye contact and smile. This is your moment, and no one but you can take that away. Make sure your costume and appearance are finalized and ready to go. You don't want a wardrobe malfunction! Your demeanor should always remain professional, but don't be afraid to show them your personality.

To be a dance competition showstopper means you must prepare and be passionate more than anything else. It's your passion that will drive you to train and prepare yourself for competing. This entire article revolves around that theme. Champions across all fields of talent will tell you the same thing. It took a lot of heart, sweat and tears to get to this point, but it's always worth it. Remember, the learning doesn't stop when your training is complete or even when the competition is over. Watch your competitors, evaluate and learn from their performances. For more tips about how to excel in your talent, look at some of my other articles located on Talent Trove. Thanks for reading and good luck with your competition!
Be Fashion Influenced in 70s Costumes

A lot of people have begun to realise just how stylish the Retro scene really is.

As we are all aware, fashion is very transient. It is constantly changing and coming up with fresh new ideas. However, it is also very dependent on previous styles. 70s costumes and accessories are very much back at the forefront of fashion at the moment. Even the images of many of today's biggest rock bands are heavily based around 70s costumes and their music has made a very noticeable return to the guitar based sound that was so popular thirty-odd years ago. Think about groups like Kasabian, Doves and Muse and then compare them with some of the big names of the 1970s such as The Rolling Stones, The Beatles, David Bowie and Marc Bolan. There are enormous similarities both with their outfits and their overall sound.

Fashion affects so many different areas of our lives. Some of these are things that are obvious to us all whilst others remained unnoticed for a lot of the time.

Another area to be very influenced by the Retro feel is cinema. You won't have to think for too long before you realise just how much. We have had a huge amount of remakes in recent years. Some of these are even still set in the time of the original movie, putting actors of today into 70s costumes. If you took away all of the films of the last five years or so that were remakes of 1970s pictures then you would be left with a lot less to watch. Admittedly, it was a time in cinema that was rich in very good quality films. Remember such classics as 'Get Carter', 'The Omen' and 'The Omega Man' - all of which have recently been remade.

Television also had some real gems to offer. Those of us who are old enough to look back on the programmes usually do so with great fondness. There always seemed to be something good to watch on the television back then; whether it was comedy, drama or science fiction. In fact many of those programmes have also been made into feature films as well.

Have a look at the celebrities of today and what they are wearing. So many of them are dressed in 70s costumes that you could be forgiven for thinking that the time machine had finally been invented.

Basically, fashion has gone full circle. Back in the 80s and 90s you would be hard pushed to find anyone wearing 'bell bottoms', flowery shirts or 'loon pants'. How things change. Suddenly it is not just acceptable to dress in 70s costumes but it is actually cool again.

So, have a hunt around in your local charity shop and on the internet. There are plenty of online businesses that specialise in nothing but 70s costumes.

One last thing that is worth remembering... don't go getting rid of any of your present day clothes as you can be sure that as soon as your children are old enough to wear them they will probably be totally 'hip'.
